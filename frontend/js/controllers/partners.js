        "name": "Bhavas of Investing",
        "desc": "<h4 class='text-center'><b>Bhavas of Investing</b></h4><p>Yoga is an ancient art based on a harmonizing system of development for the body, mind, and spirit. Most people relate Yoga to asanas (yoga postures). But there is more to yoga than this. Asanas are but one of eight limbs of yoga as laid out by the Indian Maharishi Patanjali, author of “The Yogasūtra”. They are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. So yes, asanas play a part in yoga, but they are certainly not the whole. It has been well known for centuries that the core practice of Yoga is meditation, not asanas. This is because the ultimate aim of Yoga is to create a healthy body & mind leading oneself to moksha or salvation. </p><p>The paths of Bhavas lead to the ultimate goal of 'moksha' in the Indian Yogic philosophy. Literally the word 'Bhava' stands for feeling or attitude. These Bhavas, thus, play a very important role in the path of Yoga. Regular and repeated practice of these techniques slowly enhances the accompanying 'Bhava' in one's personality. </p><p>I am a student of Yoga philosophy and professional in the finance industry, the way I look at it is that Yoga not only helps you attain peace of mind and a healthy body but its principles have universal application. You can follow these very principles defined by our Maharishis thousands of years back to create your wealth. Like I said the ultimate aim of Yoga is salvation. Let’s have a look at the Bhavas are the paths of Yoga through which moksha or salvation can be attained and how these bhavas can be applied to investing</p><br><div><h5><b>DHARMA - Duty and Right Conduct</b></h5><p>It is said that one, who is always on the path of Dharma, is saved from all sorts of pains and sufferings. Dharma in simple words means to do your duty. Similarly it’s important to do your duty before investing. Your Dharma is to research well before investing and invest basis your goals, investment horizon and risk profile. Does this mean it is your dharma to know about fundamental & technical analysis before investing? The answer is NO. However, it is your duty to identify the right source of expert advice so that your hard earned money grows. Make sure you check the success ratio before acting on expert advice.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>JNANA - Knowledge and Understanding</b></h5><p>In whatever you do, go into depths, understand and analyze it. A lot of times, we are so over-whelmed with the noise of outside world that it leads to a state of confusion and frustration. For example, people rely on hearsay and invest their hard earned money based on tips from friends / relatives expecting it to grow overnight. Now compare this to how you typically make a buying decision - you read the features, compare prices, check out the product, seek various reviews and then finally make a purchase. But when it comes to investing, we invest impulsively without thorough background check. For successful investing, you should either research well in the stock or rely on expert advice.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>VAIRAGYA - Objectivity and Detachment</b></h5><p>This is a state of detachment and egolessness. The elements of Vairagya Bhava are humility, and 'let-go' attitude. For e.g. People tend to overreact to news in stock markets that are only temporary in nature. It’s important to detach yourself from noise and check if the underlying structural or fundamental story is intact. Market guru Warren Buffet says “Only buy something that you’d be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years”. Consider the noise as buying opportunities as quality stocks also get battered down during turbulent times.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>AISHWARYA - Will-power and Self-reliance</b></h5><p>This is the culmination of all the above three Bhavas. With practice of Dharma, Jnana & Vairagya; Aishwarya is obtained. The individual becomes very clear in his life, developing strength, will power and self reliance. Therefore, when you do your Dharma/duty to select the right financial advisor, invest using the power of Jnana/knowledge and detach yourself from noise with Vairagya, you’re sure to achieve Aishwarya or a beautiful life with wealth and happiness.</p><p>With efforts, all these attitudes can be achieved & these simple yet powerful principles of Yogic Investing can help to invest optimally to create wealth.</p></div>"

        "name": "Gunas of Investing",
        "desc": "<h4 class='text-center'><b>Gunas of Investing</b></h4><p>As a finance professional and Yoga practitioner, I am intrigued by the connection between how principles of Yoga can be applied to make the right investment choices. Most people relate Yoga to asanas (yoga postures). Asanas are but one of eight limbs of yoga as laid out by the Indian Maharishi Patanjali, author of “The Yogasūtra”. They are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. So yes, asanas play a part in yoga, but they are certainly not the whole. </p><p>Yoga is about bringing various aspects of our self into balanced harmony. For instance, Patanjali Yogasūtra says that there are three gunas always present in all beings and objects surrounding us but vary in their relative amounts. These gunas are Tamas - the power of inertia, Rajas - the power of energy and Sattva - the power of harmony. A balance in our individual mix or the three qualities can also help us invest optimally</p><br><div><h5><b>Tamas - State of inertia</b></h5><p>We see a lot of people saving all their hard earned money in various fixed income products. I am consciously using the word “Savings” and not “Investments” as savings is done with the intent of capital protection and investments are done for capital growth. Savings in fixed income products do not yield significant real rate of return if you take inflation and tax into account. Therefore, the savings remain in a tamsic state or a state of inertia/inactivity. Fixed income should still form an essential part of one’s overall investment portfolio. However, one must be mindful of the allocation. A disproportionately higher skew would mean underperformance of portfolio and vice-versa may mean an aggressive or risky portfolio.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>Rajas - State of energy</b></h5><p>Rajas is an aggressive guna that is more prevalent among active stock traders. They want their money to be in constant action and movement. They get thrill from trading in stock markets mostly in the short term. I am again consciously using the word “Trading” here and not “Investing” as the intent of trading is to generate quick return in short term vis-a-vis long term investments for wealth creation. A trader doesn't go through the fundamentals of a company in detail as an investor does. He's only focused on “what's happening now, and how can I profit from it”. A trader typically trades in leveraged products like intraday, futures and options. If you are high on rajas or energy and your personal trait is that of a risk taker, if numbers and chart patterns are something that you catch your attention, then maybe you should explore trading backed by strong technical analysis or expert advice.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>Sattva - State of harmony</b></h5><p>Sattva is the guna that reduces rajas & tamas. This guna brings harmony. This is the most desirable guna or state in investing. Investors with this guna invest across various asset classes basis their goals & risk profile. They realise that equity as asset class can reduce tamas or inactivity and that it has the potential to provide multi-fold return in long-term. They reduce rajas by not constantly churning their portfolio or taking risks in the short term. They rely on stocks with strong fundamental story and don’t get bothered with short-term volatility. They don’t overly on any particular asset class and build a diversified portfolio striking balance & harmony.We have the unique ability to consciously alter the levels of the gunas in our bodies and minds. As Satvik guna is most desirable in investing, you can consciously increase it by applying simple yet powerful principles of Yogic Investing to create wealth.</p></div>"

        "name": "Panchklesha",
        "desc": "<h4 class='text-center'><b>Panchklesha of Investing</b></h4><p>My profession takes me to various investor education and awareness forums. In my interactions with investors, I have always found that the behavioural aspect of investing plays a critical role in making the right choices. I also see a great connect between Yogic principles and investor psychology.</p><p>Before I delve into the connection between the two, we must first understand the word Yoga in the right context. While most people relate Yoga to asanas, there is much more to it. Asanas constitute only one of eight limbs of ‘Ashtang Yoga’. Yoga helps you attain both a healthy body and a healthy mind. In fact Yoga is a way of life. In my opinion, there are a lot of basic principles in Yogic philosophy that one can follow in order to invest wisely and create wealth. For instance, nearly two thousand years ago, Maharishi Patanjali in Yogasutra identified five causes of suffering or pañchaklesha (‘pancha’ meaning five and ‘klesha’ meaning cause of suffering). These are Avidya (Ignorance), Asmita (Ego), Raga (Attachment), Dvesa (Aversion) and Abhinivesha (Loss). One of the objectives of Yoga is to minimise these kleshas and help the practitioner live a healthy and happy life.</p>Among investments, equity as an asset class that has historically outperformed all others. Equity has become an even more compelling asset class today, given India’s growth story. India is now the fastest growing economy, with slew of reforms and improved macros including falling twin deficits, inflation, interest rates. But despite these factors, a meagre 3% of our population invests in equity. What stops us from choosing equity? Let’s take a deeper look at this in context of the analogy of the panchkleshas.</p><br><div><h5><b>Avidya or Lack of Knowledge </b></h5><p>This is probably the biggest reason for not investing optimally. Take the example of how we make the decision to buy a mobile phone. We look up the features, compare prices, look at the product, check various reviews and then make a purchase decision. This knowledge helps us make the right choice. But when it comes to investing, many retail investors invest their hard-earned money without conducting a thorough background check on promoters or management, financial health, valuations, competitive positioning, etc. Behind every stock is a company, and learning about the company is critical to investing right. Even if you invest in equity through a mutual fund, you need to be aware about details like the investment objective, fund manager performance, investment horizon, etc.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>Asmita or Ego</b></h5><p>A know-it-all attitude can be injurious to your wealth. This typically happens during bull markets when some stocks picked up by investors are rewarded with huge profits. This gives them false sense of superiority and starts a negative loop of ignoring market signals, facts and trends. Eventually, investors take bigger gambles and over-leverage themselves. Even if you are right at times, there is always a scope of improvement, because learning is a never-ending process. Therefore, you should seek expert advice from reputed advisors or institutions to validate your views.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>Raga or Attachment</b></h5><p>Being attached to an asset class or stock is yet another bias that is best avoided. Some people get emotionally attached to an asset and end up parking all their savings in gold or real-estate. Some investors even hold on to a particular company’s stock at all times, even if the financials of the company deteriorate and there are corporate governance issues. Be wary of your emotions, as they can distract you from thinking rationally. An inclination towards a particular asset class or stock can increase portfolio concentration risk. During a downturn or negative cycle, this can erode your wealth. Diversifying your investments through asset allocation is the best way to ensure the predictability of returns.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>Dvesa or Aversion</b></h5><p>This is the opposite of Raga. Aversion to equity can happen due to a bad past experience. There are investors who have tried their hand at investing in markets and suffered losses. Historical data suggests that these retail investors enter the market at the peak of the bull-run and exit in a bear market. During a bull run, stories about stocks doubling or tripling in a short span start circulating. This makes many retail investors feel like they are missing out, and invest a lump sum, intending to make quick profits. When the market corrects, they book losses. They share their experiences with friends or relatives, which further dissuades new investors from entering the markets. But often these experiences are a result of trying to time the market. Instead of timing the market, it is important to stay invested in quality stocks over an extended period of time.</p></div><br><div><h5><b>Abhinivesha or Fear of loss</b></h5><p>This is the final barrier to healthy investing. If your stock appreciates by 10%, you may not be elated but if corrects by 10%, you feel terrible. This illustrates that investors react more to a loss than to a gain of similar magnitude. This makes most investors park their investments in fixed income, which gives them predictable returns. It is important to understand that equity will never give you linear returns, as it is risky in nature, and you may incur losses. But over the longer term, you will be creating wealth.The first step to investing optimally is to simply acknowledge your kleshas and minimise them. Become a ‘Yogic Investor’ by applying these simple mantras and watch your investments grow.</p></div>"

        "name": "States of Mind",
        "desc": "<h4 class='text-center'><b>Yoga Sutra: States of Mind</b></h4><p>Yoga helps harmoniously develop your body, mind and spirit. In fact, Yoga is a way of life. It’s overwhelming to know the vastness of the Yogic principles, its philosophy and its literature. Being a certified financial planner and a certified Yoga trainer, I must admit that I find a great connect between Yogic principles and investor psychology. Yogic principles explain in detail about Investor psychology and how it plays an important role in Investment decision making. Maharishi Patanjali in YogaSutra describes five states of mind, which ranges from severely troubled to a completely mastered mind. Let’s understand how it affects our investing behavior - </p><br><div><p><b>1.Kshipta/disturbed:</b> This state of mind is disturbed, troubled and negative. This is the least desirable state of mind. The negative mindset can be because of lack of knowledge. In investing too, our decision is affected by lack of knowledge and sub-optimal investing practices predominantly stem from this. We spend a lot of time to review and buy products online, but when it comes to investing we quickly park our hard earned money based on tips or hearsay. A large number of investors take decisions at the last moment e.g. tax planning. A comprehensive financial planning which includes goals, taxes and contingency should be envisaged with the help of an expert, to avoid impulsive investments.</p></div><br><div><p><b>2. Mudha/dull:</b> It’s a dull & heavy state of mind where we don’t want to take efforts to invest our savings in high yield assets. We leave our savings idle e.g. bank accounts or invest in other asset class which isn’t suitable as per risk appetite or goal value. In investing, we see gold and real estate as a safe haven. But gold has only performed well in uncertain times and real estate hasn’t given better returns than equity in recent past. Considering home loan interests, the real estate returns when compared to equities will be much lesser. Be active towards equity investments and not consider only the traditional route of investments for optimum returns.</p></div><br><div><p><b>3. Vikshipta/distracted:</b> Vikshipta mind is occasionally steady and is distracted easily. If you invest for a shorter tenure the chances are more to make losses. If you see markets in the short term it may seem highly volatile, but if you see for longer horizon, it continues to build an upward trajectory. It’s advisable to remain invested for longer period and not get distracted by market news and noise, to create wealth.</p></div><br><div><p><b>4. Ekagra/one-pointed -</b> The Ekagra mind is one-pointed, focused & concentrated. The chances of getting a distraction in this state of mind are negligible. It’s one of the desirable states of mind. In investing, you should be Ekagra i.e. focused towards your financial goals. It includes knowing your goals, analyzing your financial situation, risk profiling & asset allocation. Periodic monitoring and rebalancing of portfolio is required too for goal achievement.</p></div><br><div><p><b>5. Niruddah/mastered:</b> The Nirruddah mind is highly mastered & controlled. It is the most desirable state of mind. In context of investments, you master the art of investing. It’s easier said than done. To master this art, you should know how to choose stocks that the market has undervalued and they have high growth potential. The selection should be based on fundamentals like promoter’s background, commitment & vision, strengths of business & financials. Follow the principle of value investing and seek stocks that the market has undervalued. </p><p>Out of these five states of mind, the last 2 stages are most desirable and one should avoid being in first 3 states of mind. Identify your state of mind and apply these basic yogic investment principles to grow your wealth.</p></div>"

        "name": "Do Indian markets still have steam left?",
        "desc": "<div><p>Markets are in correction mode after hitting the much awaited 10,000 mark on Nifty.  Indian markets have been on roll for last couple of quarters on back of the ongoing reforms taken up by the regime, good monsoon and positive global sentiments. It has been a broad based rally driven by fundamentals and the market has created wealth for the investors all across in large caps, mid caps and small caps segment.</p></div><br><div><p>So what is the life after 10k? Are Indian markets still worth investing even at these levels? Are Indian markets still a venue for wealth creation? Let’s discuss it in details. The Indian economy has witnessed a flurry of economic reforms over last few years. These reforms are disruptive in nature and transformational in character. These reforms would have structural impact over the economy and help accelerate the expansion in future. Buoyed by the success of these reforms and the increasing political clout, the Govt. is in position to take few more bitter pills which could further improve the health of the economy in days to come and prepare it for a long haul with superior delivery performance. India is an emerging market with GDP of slightly upwards of USD 2 trillion in 2017. India GDP was at USD 541 billion in 2003, crossed USD 1 trillion in 2007 and USD 2 trillion in 2015. Indian economy had almost doubled between 2003 and 2007. It took 4 years for India GDP to double from USD 0.5 trillion to USD 1 trillion between 2003-07 in background of better global environment and 8 years from USD 1 trillion to USD 2 trillion between 2007-15 despite deteriorating global fundamentals.  In backdrop of these facts, it is expected that India GDP would reach USD 5 trillion by 2025. The economic reforms put to use over last couple of years would probably hasten the target. Now let us look at the marketperformance in the interim period. The 2003-07 market rally took the Sensex from 5000 to upwards of 21000 and Nifty trading around 1000 in 2003 to 6000 by end of 2007; markets had created wealth for all the participants- the retail investors, domestic and foreign institutions. The bottom line is the marketsreflect the underlying economic growth. Are we at a similar inflection point? Undoubtedly YES!!</p></div><br><div><p>Now let us deliberate over the factors influencing the economic growth. India is basically a domestic economy – only 25% of the GDP is driven by exports. It houses ~1.25 billion people (2nd largest population in the world) with per capita income growing at 5.7% over last 10 years; thus, India is a great consumption destination. The demographic dividends are favoring India as 65% of the population is in the working group range - 15-64 years, 29% of the population is in the range on 0-15 years of age group and only 6% of the population is above 64 years of age. Over next 2-3 decades, the demographic dividend is expected to favour India. India is at same sweet spot where US was in 1980s and China in 1990s. With this demographic dividend, the national productivity is very high, the dependency ratio is relatively low and the women in the society are also contributing to the workforce. High proportion of young population means higher productivity, more risk taking ability and higher expenditure compared to savings thus driving the demand leading to higher consumption and hence higher demand and the virtuous circle continues. Domestic consumption industry is very large. India has nearly 70 cr rural population which is almost equivalent to the size of entire Europe which houses around 74 cr people. The Indian young consumer class comprises of 50 cr people which is higher than the combined population of Brazil, Russia, Germany and UK, while the middle class accounts for 35 cr consumers which is higher than the size of US population. The potential consumption market is of pretty high magnitude.</p></div><br><div><p>India has relatively poor infrastructure if one compares it with the developed nations. There is wide disparity between the infrastructure we have and the developed nations like US, UK, and other West European nations. We have ample scope to build all weather roads, highways, bridges, waterways and seaways, airports and sea ports, mass rapid transit system etc. There is great opportunity for building new smart cities which would be equipped with all the required amenities for good quality of life within reach for all and sundry.</p></div><br><div><p>Indian workforce is well placed to capture the global opportunities. Having an English speaking, well educated generation, Indian workforce has capability to tap the opportunities in the global IT sector. Homegrown and Indian MNC software companies’ exports have cornered a niche in global IT industry. The Indian industry has reached a new peak wherein Indian Engineering, Auto and Auto ancillary, Pharma, Textiles, Leather goods companies are seen having good receptivity in the global market. Stable currency backed by robust macro-economic fundamentals and political stability is seen as another positive for export oriented industries.</p></div><br><div><p>At this juncture Indian economy is poised to benefit from both domestic consumption and global demand, thus playing on both the levers of growth though in differential proportion. This gives a good visibility of growth opportunity for the industries operating in these spheres of business. Hence, the economy and markets have a great future ahead and the 10,000 mark is just a number in the journey! </p></div>"

        "name": "How do Equity investments fare better than Debt and how can you use it to your advantage",
        "desc": "<div><p>Equity is a volatile asset class where the returns can be lumpy in nature over short term. Moreover, the equity markets are more vulnerable to various variables when compared to debt markets. As a result, people find investment in debt markets relatively safer as it guarantees a) capital protection and b) regular income source though the return would be just a tad higher than the inflation in the respective economy.  </p></div><br><div><p>Let us understand how the debt instrument works. Let us take an example of Rs 1 cr invested in a debt instrument offering a coupon rate of 7.5% for say 20 years. Thus an investor would receive Rs 7.5 lakh per annum as interest which could be used for the annual expenditure of the investor. Post tax return would be Rs 6 lakh assuming a flat tax rate of 20%. The tax outgo will vary from investor to investor depending on the tax slab he falls into and his investment planning. For simplicity we are assuming a flat tax rate of 20%. Thus investor will keep receiving post tax return of Rs 6 lakh for next 20 years and Rs 1 cr on redemption, both in absolute amount, at the end of 20th year. </p></div><br><div><p>Now let us assume an average inflation of 5% in the economy. The inflationary force reduces the value of the liquid asset by 5% every year. So what would be the value of Rs 1 cr (principle) invested in the above example after 20 years? At the end of 20 years, Rs 1 cr that the investor will receive would be sufficient enough to buy goods worth approximately Rs 0.377 cr. at current prices. That is, the purchasing power of investment has been reduced by 5% every year over 20 years giving you the corpus which is worth fraction of what it is today. So does it warrant investing in debt instrument from the point of view of even capital protection? Even the post tax receipt of Rs 6 lakh would be subject to inflation. Though the investor would receive Rs 6 lakh in absolute terms every year, the value of receipt would reduce by the prevailing inflation rate. Say for 5% inflation, the value of post tax receipts would be Rs 5.7 lakh for year 2 and so on.</p></div><br><div><p>Let us look at investing the same corpus in equities. Over the last decade and half, the Sensex has returned ~12%. That means an amount of Rs 1 cr invested on Jan 1, 2001 in Nifty would have been worth approximately Rs 6.1 cr on Dec 31, 2016. Now a question arises, ‘How should a debt investor who needs regular monthly income or annual income position himself to benefit from the investments in equities but also ensure that his regular expenses are met?’ Now invest the given corpus of Rs 1 cr in the Nifty stocks in the proportion of the weightage in the index or Nifty ETF (Nifty ETF mimics the Nifty movements). The investments in equities enjoy long term capital gains tax exemption; one can sell equities (or units in case of ETF) worth Rs 6 lakh every year from the corpus invested to receive the tax free income for consumption. Assume, the Nifty gives a return of 15% over first year of investment- Rs 1 cr would be worth 1.15 cr at the end of year 1. Now the investor would withdraw Rs 6 lakh after investment of 1 year. The remnant corpus i.e. Rs 1.09 cr would remain invested for the next year. Now assume, the next year is relatively tepid and the returns are just 6%. At the end of the year, the value of invested corpus would be Rs 1.155 cr. If the next year gives negative returns of say 5%, the value of corpus invested even after regular withdrawal of Rs 6 lakhs would be Rs 1.04 cr so on and so forth. It must be remembered that equities as an asset class have historically outperformed the rest of the asset classes and on an average has given returns of 12-15%. Even if we assume average 12% returns over next 20 years and systematic withdrawal of Rs 6 lakh every year, the corpus accumulated at the end of 20 years would be around Rs 3.03 cr, far higher than the Rs 1 cr which one would have received on investment in pure debt instrument. </p></div><br><div><p>When one compares the debt and equity instrument, one finds that the corpus invested in debt would not fall below the invested principle in absolute terms but the real value of the corpus keeps on eroding as the inflation eats it out, whereas in case of equities the value of invested corpus would be volatile over short time period but due to power of compounding it outperforms both inflation and other asset classes over long period of investments. Do you still think Equity is not a better instrument for investments?</p></div>"

            title: "How to save during the festive season",
            content: "<p>How to manage your finance and enthusiasm of overspending, with the festival season around the corner.</p> <p>The festival of Ganpati has just got over. But the festival season has just begun. It will be soon followed by Navaratri, Dusherra and Diwali. With so many festivals coming up over the next couple of months, it is indeed very tempting to splurge on shopping for the family or buying gifts for friends and relatives or even customers if you are the owner of a business.</p> <p>Most of the people tend to go overboard in spending during the festive season, to show their love towards their near and dear ones. And many end up in debts at the end of it all. So how does one avoid the trap of over spending yet at the same time striking a balance for spending? We list out some tips and tricks that you can use to curb the splurging instinct and keep your finances in check.</p><p>Plan, plan and more planning, that is the most important key to reign in your spending habits during the festive season. You should ideally have started saving a small amount every month so that you have a decent amount of corpus when the festivities are at hand. If you have not done it this time around, you can always plan for the next year. The next question then is what is the amount that I should save every month? To answer this question, it is first important to know what your budget is. </p><p>Arriving at a budget number is the second most important element after planning. There are various ways that you can arrive at a budget; the simplest is to decide a percentage of your income to set aside every month or a percentage of your income during the festive months that you can afford. While planning for the budget, ensure that your other financial goals like housing loans, or any other loans or your investment planning is not affected. </p><p>If you are entitled to a bonus around the festive season, then you should ideally not blow up the entire bonus amount on festivities. Instead sit down with your spouse and family members and apportion the bonus. Of the 100 % amount, 25 % should be allocated towards the festivities. 25 % of the amount should be used for shoring up your contingency fund and the balance 50 % should be used to pre pay any outstanding debts and loans that you may have in your name. Once you do this exercise the expectation of all the household members is set. You now have a budget to work around with. With the 25 % amount of your bonus you can now go about planning and creating a list of all items that you require for your shopping and gifting. The 25 % budget ensures that you tax your grey cells, to seek out thoughtful gift items rather than indulging in expensive gift items. Also it will lead you to check if the things that you have shortlisted are available on sale either online or offline and if not. Be wary of advertisements that proclaim a sale, before you make an actual purchase, do your homework and scout around other websites or shops to check if the price mentioned is indeed at a sale price. This approach will make you rethink on your strategy and arrive at a more comfortable list of items that fit into your budget.</p><p>You can also take advantage of tax benefits, if you make some donation to charity. People, who are underprivileged and less fortunate than us, too deserve to partake in the festivities. So one can spare a though for these people and donate accordingly. </p><p>It would be wise to avoid taking any form of loans for the festive seasons, or maxing out your credit cards. These are financial burdens that you will need to pay over a period of time.</p><p>One last thing you can do is, to start building a corpus for the next year’s festive seasons. Again keep in mind that for next year too, the key is planning and arriving at a budget which will steer you in the right direction.</p>",

Then secretary of state of India approved the same under her Majesty. Back then the intention was to create a welfare scheme which was beneficial to employees in the postal service. Employees of the telegraph department were later incorporated. The limit of sum assured currently stands at rupees fifty lakhs, but back in 1884 it was rupees four thousand.</p><p>The salient feature of the postal life insurance scheme is the high rate of returns that one gets on the premium paid for the life insurance cover. </p><p>The advantage of this policy is that one can avail loan against the policy. There are basically two types of policy 1) Whole life Assurance and 2) Endowment Assurance policy. Employees who opt for PLI can avail tax benefits under the Income Tax act Section 88.

            id: "how-to-calculate-MAB",
            title: "How to calculate MAB (Monthly Average Balance)",
            content: "<p>Simple steps to calculate the formula to compute the average monthly balance for your savings bank account.</p> <p>If you do not maintain a monthly average balance in your savings account, the bank with whom you are holding the savings account will levy a penalty for not maintaining MAB. The levied fines can range from Rs 250 to Rs 350 and varies from bank to bank and also on the amount of minimum monthly average balance mandated by your bank. So the first step is to find out from your bank what is the MAB required for the savings account that you have opted for. Also the penalties levied. At times banks can levy penalties in slabs. For example if the MAB for your account is Rs 10000, then if the MAB falls below comes down to Rs 5000 then banks will charge a flat rate of Rs 250, however if it falls below Rs 5000 then banks may charge Rs 350. The above are examples and you should find out from your bank what the slabs are. Banks charge you a penalty to cover their day to day operational costs</p><p>When banks started the concept of MAB, there was a huge backlash and protests against the same, but still banks have held on to this concept. So let us understand what is the definition of MAB or Monthly Average Balance, as it is known and also understand how to calculate the same. You must have come across this term with your own bank. </p><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The total amount residing in your bank’s savings account, <strong>after the close of a day</strong> is calculated. For example if your bank account had Rs 10000 at 9.30 am on let’s say 21st June, and if you have paid Rs 2000 during the day, let’s say at 10.30 am and for the rest of the day you have not done any transactions. Then your <strong>end of the day</strong> closing balance is Rs 8000. So if you had Rs 8000 in your bank account for 30 days then the calculation will be 8000 X 30 = 240000</p><p>This closing balance is divided by the number of days in that month, including all Sundays and public holidays, this calculation works out Rs 240000/30 = 8000.</p><p>Now that we have understood the definition, does it mean that if my bank requires Rs 5000 as MAB, then I need to have at least Rs 5000 at the end of every day in my savings bank account for the entire month? Since the computation is done on the basis of monthly average, the answer is no. Let us take an example to understand the same, where the bank has mandated a MAB of Rs 5000.</p><p> As per the above calculation, you can either have Rs 5000 at the end of every day for the duration of the entire month OR, if you have Rs 1, 50,000 (One lakh fifty thousand) in your account at the end of the day even for any one day during the month it means you have an MAB of Rs 5000 for the month. Since the total amount at the end of the day was Rs 150000 and even if you have Rs 0 every day for the balance 29 days in a month. The total at the end of the month will be Rs 150000. (I hope you are with me so far). This total (150000) divided by the number of days in the month (30) will give you Rs 5000 as MAB for the month. </p><p>This amount of Rs 150000 can be staged over a few days too, so if you Rs 50000 in your account for three days and the Rs 0 for the rest of the 27 days, the MAB still works out to Rs 5000. I hope you will be able to compute this on your own from the above example.</p><h5>A few tips to have a low MAB.</h5><ul><li>Consolidate your bank accounts and keep the bare minimum number of bank accounts required. Having multiple accounts means, having to maintain an MAB in every bank. So if you have 4 four bank accounts and the MAB required in each is Rs 5000 then, your monthly MAB for all the four accounts will be Rs 20000.</li><li>Private sector banks will generally have higher MAB’s as compared to Public sector banks. Private sector banks have been known to charge as high as Rs 10000 as MAB for basic savings account and this amount can become exorbitant as you go in for higher grade of savings account. Public sector banks on the other hand charge anywhere between Rs 1000 to Rs 5000 as MAB. So choose banks carefully based on your needs.</li><li>If you are technically savvy then activate your internet banking services, this way you can monitor your closing balance at the <strong>end of the day</strong> and do your own calculations.</li><li>While most of the banks consider the start date of the month as the 1st of every month, exceptionally some banks may have different dates, like 5th to the 4th of next month or from the 7th to the 6th of next month.</li><li>Banks will pay you interest on the amount that you hold in MAB. Most of the banks offer up to 4%. The formula to calculate the interest is shown below:</li><li><ul><li>Interest (monthly) = End of day balance X Number of days X Interest / No of days in a year. </li><li>So if your balance at the end of the day works out to Rs 10000, then the interest provided by your bank is @ 3% per annum then the computation is as shown below.</li><li>Interest (monthly) = 10000  X 30 X (3/100)  /365 = Rs 24.65</li></ul></li><li>What many people do not know is that such interest generated up to Rs 10000 can be exempt from tax under the 80TTA section of the income tax act. Only HUF and individual can claim this exemption. This is also over and above the limit Rs 1, 50,000 under section 80 C.</li></ul><p>That’s it. The maths is that simple. I hope you now will be able to calculate the MAB on your own for your requirement and also maintain the same either throughout the month or on a single day or by staggering the amount over multiple days. </p>",

The key changes have been made for ITR 1 which covers the salaried class, the people earning a pension, the people having income from alternative sources such as rent or other financial instruments. The government has created a single page document to simplify the process of filling the ITR for the common man. This form now can be filled even if you are not very financially savvy and have just a basic working knowledge of finance, you need not engage the services of a finance professional for the same.</p> <p>This change is humongous and the government hopes to encourage the filling of forms by more than 90 per cent of the tax payers.</p> <p>For the financial year 2017 – 18 the key modifications and their application are provided below for your easy reference. </p><p> <table border='1'> <tr> <td>Form Number</td> <td>How is it applicable</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ITR 1</td> <td>Individuals whose income does not exceed 50 lakh rupees, this includes, salary paid by the employer, interest from various financial instruments, and single house asset. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>ITR 2</td> <td>ITR 2 is now a combination of the earlier ITR2, ITR 2A, and ITR 3.

Under the probable income, non-digital and digital receipts under section 80EE are good initiatives.  Let us have a look at some of the key changes that have been implemented.</p><p><strong>ITR (1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 and 7):</strong> Cash that has been deposited between the period 9th November 2016 and 30th December 2016. This was the period when demonetization took place in India and if an individual has deposited cash in excess of two lakh rupees, then they need to make this disclosure in the new column which has been added across all the ITR forms. </p><p><strong>ITR (1 | 2 | 3 | and 4):</strong> Aadhar number made mandatory. In the mentioned ITR form numbers, you need to quote the Aadhar card number, in case one has applied for a Aadhar card, then one needs to quote the enrolment number in the ITR forms. This is necessary.</p><p><strong>ITR (2 | 3 | 5 | 6 and 7):</strong> Inexplicable source of revenue will be taxed at distinctive charges. You need to report inexplicable source of revenues underneath schedule OS. A new column has been added for this purpose. There is a 60 percent tax rate applicable on this inexplicable source of revenue.</p><p><strong>ITR (2 | 3 | and 4):</strong> Deductions done under the section 80 EE of the income tax act. The permissible limit currently stands at two lakh rupees under Section 24 (b) of the house property act. For people buying their first home, the interest on the home loan can be deducted under section 80EE up to   fifty thousand rupees, this is in addition to the exemption claimed under section 24 (b). The new ITR form contains a new field for the same.</p><p><strong>ITR (2 | 3 | and 4):</strong> HUF’s and individuals whose income exceeds 50 lakh rupees. Liabilities and assets for HUF’s and individuals need to be declared if the income goes beyond 50 lakh rupees. The government introduced this act in the last financial year. The current cost of ownership of property, jewellery, gold, automobiles, equities, cash in hand and in the banks was  required to be mentioned by HUF’s and individual tax payers . Further to this it is now mandated to reveal the address of the house or property that is owned, along with all the above listed assets in the new income tax return forms.  In case of any association or interest held in a firm that has a partner or a member, one needs to provide the PAN number of the association or firm in which the individual is associated.</p><p><strong>ITR (3 and 5):</strong> Particulars of the CA firm leading the audit. It is mandatory to reveal the membership number, the name of the CA firm, the PAN number of the CA firm that is the signing authority for the audit.</p><p><strong>ITR 4:</strong> In case of probable taxation, the digital and other receipts are separated. Eight percent of the total receipts submitted or the turnover is considered as income for the tax payer under section 44AD of the income tax act. For digital receipts this has been reduced to six percent . In the ITR 4 additional columns have been introduced to reveal the turnover obtained via digital mode of payments. Respectively the columns have been introduced for probable taxation of porbable income as the rate of six and eight percent. The PAN number which has been linked to the Aadhar card is valid, whereas the rest of the PAN cards are invalid. For people who had quoted multiple PAN numbers, this exercise has helped in cleaning out the invalid PAN numbers. This has also aided in scrutinizing the deposits made during demonetization. The simplification move by the government should lead to more number of people to pay tax as per the compliance. The changes should be welcome move for the tax payers.</p>",

            title: "Excuses avoiding, for not having a health cover",
            content: "<p>Statistically Indians have a low awareness about health cover insurance. Due to this majority of us tend to underestimate or do not accord enough importance to having a health cover. In a fast paced life which is usually peppered with stress, one needs to understand the importance of having a health cover. Let us look at some of the top excuses that people have for not having a health cover.</p> <p><strong>I am healthy and fit:</strong> Most people when they are young think that they are healthy and fit and do not need any health cover. What they fail to understand is that the human body is a complex machine, and you never really can predict what will happen at any given point of time. You may have hereditary illnesses which can crop up any time. Or you may be taken ill due to work related stress, or lifestyle or pollution. You could also be the victim of an accident. Whatever the reason, if you do not have a health cover you will be staring at big dent in your pocket.</p> <p><strong>Lack of funds:</strong> I do not earn enough and lack the funds to buy a health cover. This is the biggest excuse that people make for not having a health insurance. Even if you are on your first job, you should make it a priority to accord some money towards basic health insurance. This is an important step towards financial planning. You will have the advantage of locking in lower premiums as you grow older. </p><p><strong>I have no dependents:</strong> This is again not a valid excuse, as you may be alone at that point in time, however from a future perspective you will may have a spouse and children or you may have your parents as dependants. In case of any eventuality they will have adequate safe-guards in such a scenario.</p><p><strong>I have a group policy:</strong> We are under the impression that since our company has a corporate tie up with an insurance company, we do not need our own independent health insurance cover. This is far from the truth. You need to find out how much health cover you are eligible for, it may not be enough in case of any unfortunate circumstance. Also you will be covered till such time you are in the employment. If for any reason you have to change jobs, your new company may or may not have health insurance package, and if they do you will have to be without one during the transition phase. It is best to have your own independent policy is well during this period.</p><p><strong>I do not get any returns:</strong> The aim of an insurance policy is not to provide returns, there are other instruments that will take care of that necessity like fixed deposits, mutual funds etc. The objective of an insurance policy is that you are taken care of in various circumstances like job loss, death, accident etc. However, there are certain insurance providers who provide money back policies at a higher premium. You will have to choose what is best for you. Insurance companies also provide a no claim bonus till such time you actually claim any monies. This helps in keeping the premium costs on the lower side.</p><p><strong>I am a home maker:</strong> The idea of an insurance policy is that it should act as a substitute for income arising from any kind of loss. While majority of the income loss does tend to come from the working person, one needs to understand that while a home maker does not necessarily get paid, the tasks that they carry out on a day to day basis, will require money in case of the death of the home maker. For example, baby sitting, tuitions etc. You can read more about this by clicking here. Hence it is necessary that a home maker is also adequately covered.</p><p><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> This should be your top financial goal. If it isn’t, we recommend that you prioritise this one right away. After your retirement, you are dependent on your savings that you may have planned. You may have a part time job to supplement your income. In case of any untoward event like death, the living dependents will need an income to sustain their future life. Hence it is imperative that you have insurance cover even after retirement. We reiterate that if you have started insurance at an early stage, the premiums will be on the reasonable levels as you age.</p><p><strong>Very high premiums:</strong> This is where it gets a bit tricky, if you are starting off at an early age, then the premiums levels are quite low, and if you are facing high premiums, it could be a case of bad selling, or lack of awareness as to what one should get insured for. At times insurance agents sell the policy that will provide them with the highest commission, while this practise is not common, you still may come across some unscrupulous elements. There is also something called over insuring one self, wherein the premiums may sky rocket. You need to calculate based on your current net worth and other parameters, how much insurance do you really need. Take the help of an expert advisor or a financial planner if you have difficulties, arriving at a number on your own.</p><p>They say one size does not fit all, so in this day and age, most of the insurance companies will allow you to customize or have add-on’s to your existing policy, so that you can cater to your specific requirements.  Now that you have a fair idea of the excuses, that people give, and if you still do not have a health insurance policy, we suggest that you immediately remedy the situation at the earliest and hope that nothing untoward occurs in your life.</p>",

            content: "<p>Parents in India dote on their children, and majority of them tend to go out of the way to fulfil the needs and wants of their children. In the bargain they forget to inculcate in their children the value of money. While one should start financial education at an early age, it is never too late to teach them the value of money. If you have children who are 18 years and above then you need to have a different approach towards providing them tips for money matters. We recommend some of the tips on a broader scale below, you may modify them, to suit your requirements towards your children as one size does not fit all.</p> <p><strong>Teach them to be penny-wise:</strong> As the saying goes, money saved is money earned. Get them to adopt this motto. 18 year olds tend to spend a lot on “wants” rather than “needs”. Teach them to focus on the needs. For example a pair of unbranded jeans, or trousers, or shirts or shoes, will cost much less than branded one’s. Alternatively if for a specific piece of clothing they want to have a particular brand, let them know the value of picking up the same items during a sale. There are multiple outlets both offline and online having sales during festive seasons, or end of the year sales or stock clearance sale. A brand purchased during a sale will be a much lower price, thus resulting into savings. </p><p><strong>Investment Goals:</strong> Coach them on the art of investment, the earlier the better. Show them the power of compounding, if they start salting away money, every month into investment avenues, they will be investing less amount every month if they start off early. But will need to double or triple their savings every month if they start investing late. Imbibe in them that savings for goals need to be of three main categories, short term goals, medium term goals and long term goals. Accordingly they need to invest proportionately. With the vast amount of knowledge available on the internet, most of them can work this out on their own, if the they need to fine tune it ask them to take advise from a financial consultant.</p><p><strong>Counsellors:</strong> Ask your children to seek out a mentor who is expert in the field of finance. This may be someone you know immediately in your family or circle of friends, or through various networks that they may cultivated during the college days. They need to find someone whom they can look up to, so that it is easier to take advice from these mentors. Tell them to establish a rapport with the mentor and seek advice regularly till they gain all the requisite skills. Having a good mentor will be an invaluable ally to have for the children.</p><p><strong>Credit score:</strong> Your children may already be working full time or part time, or will complete their graduation or post-graduation and then look for employment. Whatever the scenario, let them know the value of building a good credit score right from the beginning. Lead by example and pay your bills like electricity and phone bills on time. Let them pay their phone bills, internet bills, credit card bills (if any) on or before the due date. Once they absorb this, they will thank you for it, in their later life, when they apply for student or other loans and these will not be rejected due to having a good credit score.</p><p><strong>Overheads:</strong> Teach them to control the outflow of cash.

            content: "<p>You may inadvertently file incorrect income tax returns (ITR). You may file the same either yourself or through a third party firm or consultant.  The consultant may advise you on various methods to avoid tax or to modify certain areas in your salary structure, so that your tax liability is reduced. The reasons could be many, but have you stopped to think about the consequences of these actions? What happens if your ITR comes under scrutiny or you get a notice from the income tax department asking to explain yourself? You need to remember that you alone are liable for any wrong filing of ITR, knowingly or unknowingly. The income tax department will not hold the person who has filed the ITR on your behalf liable, they will hold you responsible. In India tax evasion knowingly or unknowingly is considered to be a criminal offence and you could land up behind bars along with a hefty penalty that will be levied. Apart from this the income tax department can report you to your employer, thus putting your job at stake. So beware of so called expert advisors who will entice you by reducing your tax outgo through nefarious means. Always stay with someone who has an established credibility and the ones who work as per the income tax laws that are in force currently.</p> <p>Now that we have established who is liable, let us see some corrective solutions to filing revised returns to correct any anomaly that you may have identified.</p> <p>The income tax department allows you to filed revised returns, provided you have filed your income tax on or before the due date. This is generally the 31st of July. This year it was extended up to 31st August.  Section 139 (5) allows us to file corrected returns before the 31st of March of the current financial year or before completing the year of assessment whichever is earlier. However from the year 2017 – 18 onward the revision of ITR can also be filed after the due date.</p> <p>You can revise your ITR multiple times after you have filed them. But doing so may invite a scrutiny from the income tax department which one should try and avoid. So if you have realized that there is an error while filing returns. The next time you revise the returns, ensure that you have done all the necessary corrections at one go. Within due date if you do not file your tax returns, you will be charged interest under section 234A.</p><p>If the revision in the ITR results into more tax outgo, then you will be charged an interest which falls under section 234C & 234B this is levied on non-payment of advance taxes. These interest amounts and taxes can be paid vide challan number 280. Ensure that you have entered the challan details on the revised ITR. If you fail to do so, it will be considered as a faulty return, due to the additional tax that is payable by you.</p><p>When you file a revised return either for the first time or multiple times thereafter, you need to enter the acknowledgement number from the original ITR in all the subsequent revised forms. You can do so by physical mode or by filing the same online as well. Please note that if you have filed the original return online, then only you will be able to file the revised ITR online. </p><p>Once you file the returns online, you will need to verify the same via Aadhar one time password (OTP), or net banking. The physical ITR-V can be sent to Bangalore CPC. But do remember to send the ITR-V of the revised ITR. The ITR-V is sent to you as an attachment from the income tax department to your email id that you have registered with them.</p><p>In conclusion remember that if the correction was not intended then revision is permitted. If the intention is proved to be deliberate then you will be prosecuted and may be imprisoned under section 277 of the Indian Penal Code. The income tax department may also levy a penalty ranging from 100 to 300 per cent of the tax that is due.</p><p>To avoid any unnecessary scrutiny, it is best if you can correctly file your ITR the first time.</p>",

            content: "<p>You may even be doing investments on your own based on advice from friends, media or investment gurus. While investment generally is done by financial pundits, you too can manage your own investments, by gaining knowledge of the investment avenues that one has. Today in the digital era it is easy to do research online and come up with a plethora of information regarding financial products. This is the same information that was once privy only to the financially savvy people. The internet age has brought the common man on par with all this information. It is now up to the common man to disseminate the same and apply the same to their investments. We will provide you tips on how to handle investments on your own. Please note that these are just guidelines and one need to study the various avenues available.</p> <p>Let us understand the various investment options and the type of risks associated with them, which are available in India for investing.</p> <p><strong>Fixed deposits:</strong> These have been the primary source of investments for the masses. These are among the safest avenues for investing and have assured returns. If you have lesser risk appetite that is if you have a traditional view on investments then fixed deposits are the way to go. Banks and financial institutions offer a wide range of fixed deposits based on tenure and the rate of interest. The rate of interest is generally decided by individual banks based on the economic conditions that are prevalent and are governed by the RBI. You can avail tax benefits on long term fixed deposit of over five years. Overdraft and loan options are also available against fixed deposits for investors.</p><p><strong>Recurring Deposits:</strong> Offered by post offices and banks, these are again assured returns based on a fixed time period. The investor can deposit a predefined amount every month for a fixed period which may be short term or long term. The predefined amount can be revised and increased year on year based on the investor’s increments or revenue generation options. The rate of interest is fixed by the institution’s offering the recurring deposit option. The idea is to build a substantial amount of monies over a period of time.</p><p><strong>Public Provident Fund (PPF):</strong> The PPF can be used to avail tax benefits if one stays invested for the long term. One needs to stay invested for a minimum period of fifteen years. During this period one can avail loan or withdraw partial funds. The government of India decides the rate of interest for the PPT every quarter. The major benefit of PPF is that, after the minimum fifteen years, the amount of monies accrued is completely free of tax. </p><p><strong>Employee Provident Fund (EPF):</strong> Similar to PPF, the rate of interest is decided by the government of India on a quarterly basis. An investor can claim tax deduction under section 80C of the income tax act. EPF’s are generally deducted by the employer from the employee’s salary and an equal amount is deposited by the employer. After the EPF matures, the amount of monies accrued is completely free of tax.</p><p><strong>National Pension System (NPS):</strong> This is a relatively new avenue of investment. One can stay invested in this option till one retires from their active job. The NPS does investments in equities too hence one can get higher returns which are more than PPF and EPF. After the NPS matures, the amount of monies accrued is not completely free of tax. To provide the investor with a pension regularly a part of the amount is used to buy annuity.</p><p><strong>Mutual Funds:</strong> These have become quite popular and a buzz word in recent years. Companies that run mutual funds collect investment amounts from numerous investors and then group the money with an aim to invest it in various activities to generate optimal returns. These returns are then passed on to the investors. There are primarily two categories of mutual funds, debt funds and equity based funds. Debt funds will invest your money in bonds and papers, whereas equity based funds will invest your money in the stock market. You will also come across a fusion of both debt and equity based mutual funds. These are known as hybrid mutual funds. Mutual funds provide you the easy and convenience to start and stop at a time of your choosing. You can withdraw from a mutual fund anytime, except for mutual funds which save tax.</p><p><strong>Stocks:</strong> The favourite avenue of many, it comes with inherent risks and one should have a complete understanding and knowledge of the same. Stocks or shares that you buy of listed companies are held by investors for long term, they can have a horizon of anywhere between minimum of 10 years to 25 to 40 years. Please do not confuse investing in stocks with trading in stocks which is a short term activity and is considered to be speculative.</p><p>To generate long term wealth it is important to invest in various asset classes and instruments mentioned above, for various reasons, such as retirement planning, funding your children’s higher education, to maintain or enhance your lifestyle in the long term or to be able to accomplish the goals that you have chalked out for yourself and your family.</p><p>The different types of investment avenues are given above. It is advisable to diversify and have a balanced allocation of your assets in all types of assets. This distribution will be based on factors such as your risk appetite, or your age or your target for achieving certain goals.</p>",

            title: "Avoid ATM fraud checklist",
            content: "<p>You may have surely heard of ATM frauds that take place via newspapers or through social media like face book and WhatsApp. You may think ATM frauds will never happen to me, but that could be far from the truth. Though we are in a digital age, there are still older methods that are being used by people who do ATM fraud. One needs to be aware of the various types of ATM frauds that are currently known and how to avoid them. We will show you some of the most common methods and ways to prevent ATM fraud.</p> <p>One cannot stress the importance of being alone inside the ATM while withdrawing cash. If there are people who are withdrawing cash from the ATM, wait for them to complete their transaction and come out, only then enter the ATM. If you find people waiting aimlessly around the ATM, ask them to leave before you begin your transaction.</p> <p>There may be circumstances when you need cash in a hurry or are traveling either locally or may be abroad and you will not have the comfort of visiting your regular ATM. If you are not at your regular ATM even if you are in a hurry, take a moment and beware of the surroundings before you enter the ATM.  If you do have to remove cash, try and locate an ATM that is inside the premises of a bank, these are much safer, than standalone ATM’s. It is difficult for scammer’s to commit fraud at such ATM’s .</p><p>Avoid using the ATM if:</p><p><ul><li>The ATM you are at does not have ample amount of lighting</li><li>If there are no cameras around the ATM</li><li>The location of the ATM is in a remote place and is not around a crowded public place.</li><li>If there people who may be loitering around suspiciously. Some criminals may also rob you at knife point or gun point</li><li>Avoid help from strangers who may offer to help, if you are not sure, how to operate the ATM machine. It is advisable to call up the bank to ask for help. Phone numbers of the respective banks are always listed inside the ATM</li></ul></p><p>Once you are inside the ATM booth, check the slot where you insert the card for any signs of tampering, if it has been tampered with, it may be loose or may get easily removed. Scammers use a technique called skimming, via a device which is either inserted inside the card slot or over the actual card slot of the ATM. This device reads the magnetic strip to collect data related to your ATM card. A small spy camera is also installed over the numeric keypad to capture your ATM PIN. </p><p>Check for cameras that may be installed overhead that may be able to capture the PIN as you enter it. Some ATM’s have a flap over the numeric keypad so that your hand movements are not visible, however, scammers have gone to extreme lengths to install pinhole camera’s under these flaps as well. In case there is flap covering the numeric keypad, it is a good idea to check underneath the flap for any signs of a hidden camera. If you think the slot is loose or there is an additional device attached, avoid using the ATM. </p><p>Also check the cash dispensing unit for signs of tampering. Scammer’s will try to block the cash dispenser or add an additional dummy box over the actual cash dispenser. When you withdraw cash, the machine will actually dispense the cash into the dummy box or it may not come out completely. You may think this is a malfunction of the machine and walk away. Once you walk away the scammer will then retrieve the cash from the machine. If you think the ATM machine has been tampered in any of the above ways, immediately report it to the bank or relevant authorities.</p><p>Once you are satisfied that the slot where you insert your ATM card or the cash dispenser has not tampered with you can begin your transaction. Ensure that you are standing as close to the ATM as possible. While entering the PIN number cover the numeric keypad with your other hand, this is to prevent from any hidden spy cameras that maybe setup by fraudsters to record your Pin number or hand movements. Covering the keypad may seem old fashioned or childish, but it is very important to avoid ATM fraud as scammer’s will require the PIN number though they may have obtained your ATM card data via skimming.</p><p>Once you have completed your transaction, quickly count your cash and press the cancel button on the ATM, wait for the welcome screen to appear, before you exit the ATM.</p><p>There are certain ATM’s which require you to swipe your card on the door before entering the ATM, you need to beware that these swipe machines on the doors can also capture your data.</p><p>In India, the RBI too has put in motion a machinery to ensure that ATM frauds are minimized. They have instructed all banks to upgrade their ATM’s in a phased manner. <a href='https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11311&Mode=0' target='_blank'>Click here</a> to view the details of these preventive measures initiated by the RBI. </p><p>Banks have upgraded their ATM cards to chip technology. If you still use an old ATM card without the chip, you can request your bank to upgrade you to a card which has an electronic chip embedded in it. While data can still be read off the magnetic strip of the card, the chip versions are more secure.</p><p>Lastly check your bank statements for any discrepancies in the transactions. In spite of all the precautions, if you think your ATM card has been compromised, call up the bank immediately and block the card.</p>",

            title: "Common mistakes while filing Income Tax Return Form in India",
            content: "<p>As per a leading Indian newspaper the last date for filing income tax for the year 2017 &ndash; 2018 has now been extended to 31st August 2018. For those of you who have missed the July 31st deadline, this is great news indeed. You can now file your tax before the 31st August to avoid any penalties up to rupees 10 000/- if you fail to adhere to deadlines.</p> <p>If you are someone who is technically savvy and plans to file the tax returns on your own, kindly have a checklist of the common mistakes that one should avoid during this process. We have highlighted 15 points as your checklist.</p> <h5>1) Evading filing your tax returns every year:</h5> <p>Please avoid this mistake, as it could be costly for you in the long run, eventually the long arm of the law will catch up with you. Even if you are not eligible for income tax, you should file your returns as &ldquo;Zero&rdquo;</p> <h5>2) Incorrect ITR Form:</h5> <p>You should be disclosing all income sources, like rent from house if any, annual interest on savings accounts, fixed deposits or any other investments that you may have made. If you choose the wrong ITR form, then the income tax department will tag it as faulty and will return the same to you. The income tax department will provide you with 15 days&rsquo; time to fill in the correct form. The assessing officer may or may not extend the time limit. If you do not revert within the time limit then the officer will tag it as a void return. This is equivalent to not filing tax for the year. And the same penalties will apply as mentioned in point number1. Before filing your returns you need to check your form 26 AS, to verify if your employer has done all the necessary deductions like TDS at their end. If not you will have to get it rectified and then file for returns.</p> <h5>3) Not declaring incomes which are Tax free:</h5> <p>As mentioned above you have to declare all sources of income even if some of the income is tax free. Not reporting these in your returns could attract penalties and actions. You can however claim exemptions and report it under Exempt Income part in the ITR form.</p> <h5>4) Not reporting all your bank accounts:</h5> <p>You may hold multiple bank accounts in your name, like your personal savings, account, joint accounts with your spouse, parents or children, or salary accounts, or current accounts if you have business interests. If the account is dormant then you may not report it. </p> <h5>5) Correction to your tax filing mistakes:</h5> <p>If you discover at a later stage that is after filing the tax returns that you have made a mistake, then as per the income tax laws the department allows you time up to one year to correct the mistakes and file the revised returns. The one year rule came into effect from the year 2017 &ndash; 2018.</p> <h5>6) Submitting false documents:</h5> <p>If you submit documentations which are false for items like rent, house rent allowance (HRA), Leave travel allowance (LTA) in the form of fake tickets, fake insurance receipts for claiming under section 80 C or false mediclaim receipts. It will be considered as a fraud and accordingly you will be penalized under the Indian law for fraud and evasion. 7) Non-disclosure of part time jobs: If you have a part time job or jobs, it is important that you club the income received from these jobs to your income tax returns. Only disclosing salary</p> <h5>8) Unexplained income drop:</h5><p> Income drop can happen due to a number of reasons, for the salaried class this could happen if you have changed jobs and have not reported the income from the previous employer to the new employer. It could happen during global recession, that if you lose your job or have to take a significant cut in the salary. When the income tax department sees a sudden drop in the salary, this is a red flag for them as they would think that you are concealing income. The same would apply to business class, though the very nature of business is at times to have a sudden drop in income. But this might be understood as tax evasion, or concealment.</p> <h5>9) Unusually high refunds:</h5><p> Tax paying persons, who tend to claim an unusually high amount of refunds, will come under the radar of the income tax. The income tax department generally does not like to give out tax refunds, as they expect the tax payer to have correctly filled in the form and submitted all the necessary documents of investments. The tax officers may serve you a notice, and ask you to substantiate your claims in such situations and you need to have all the necessary documents in place.</p> <h5>10) Inflating donations to charity or NGO&rsquo;s:</h5><p> Tax exemptions are allowed if you can furnish receipts and documents for monies submitted to charitable institutions, NGO&rsquo;s or to political organizations. Such donations will fall under scrutiny if the amount shows in very high. If you have also created fake documents to show donations you will be served an income tax notice.</p> <h5>11) Investments for minors:</h5><p> If you have done long term investing for your children who are minors and if there is income generated from these investments on an annual basis then you have to join this income along with your primary income when you are filing income tax returns.</p> <h5>12) Landlord PAN number:</h5><p> Gone are the days when one could submit HRA to the maximum limit, submit the receipts and claim tax exemptions. From now on the income tax departments also wants to know the PAN number of your landlord as if the amount is high then they would like to collect tax from the landlord as well. So ensure that you have your landlord&rsquo;s PAN number. The income tax department can also ask you to provide the registered rent agreement copy to verify the amount of rent claimed.</p> <h5>13) Form 15H and 15G:</h5><p> If you have income which comes under the tax bracket, you are not eligible to fill in form 15H and form 15G. Be aware that this should be filled only if your overall income does not cross the taxable limit imposed.</p> <h5>14) Advance tax and self-assessment tax:</h5><p> You need to disclose to the income tax authorities in advance if you are liable for self-assessment or advance tax and the same should be paid on time.</p> <h5>15) Return signed copy to Income tax department:</h5><p> When the income tax department sends you the ITRV after you have filed the ITR, then you have to sign the copy as an acknowledgement and send it back to the income tax department by ordinary post only and not through courier. This has to be done within 120 days. </p> <p>Please follow the above guidelines, to ensure a smooth process for filing of ITR, so that you do not come under the scrutiny of the income tax department.</p>",

            content: "<p>The first question that comes to mind is what is tax evasion? Is tax avoidance the same as tax evasion? The answer is a resounding no. Both are different. Tax avoidance at a simplistic level is reducing the tax that you have to pay via various legal laws provided by the government. For salaried class some of the ways to avoid tax are by investing in section 80C and various other sections in order to reduce the tax outgo. For the business class it is by submitting bills and receipts of all expenses incurred like telephone bill, electricity bill etc. Tax avoidance is to find ways and means to reduce your tax liability within the legal ambit of the law. </p> <p>Coming to the main top of tax evasion it basically means not paying taxes which are owed to the government. The intention is to deliberately conceal the various ways and means by which this can be done. It can be practiced by both the salaried as well as the business class.</p> <p>Mentioned below are some of the means that you must completely avoid to evade tax. The prominent means that make it to the top of the list are: <ul><li>Under valuing your income or not disclosing your income or other sources of income</li><li> Evading duty on imported goods (Customs duty)</li> <li>Not disclosing your accumulated wealth (Wealth Tax)</li><li> Forging your balance sheet or finance related statements</li><li> Black money or bribery in the form of cash for services rendered</li><li> Providing the incorrect PAN number or not providing the PAN number</li><li> Not checking the self-assessment documents carefully, In India it is form 26AS before filing the tax returns</li></ul></p> <p>Sometimes salaried individual are under the impression that since tax is deducted by the employer, they do not have to do anything. This is due to lack of knowledge, you have to submit your investment details like post office investment, interest on Fixed Deposits and interest accrued from savings bank account or if you have any other source of income which needs to be clubbed with your salary income. Not having the required knowledge is not an excuse that the income tax department will accept. Hence it is better to gain knowledge or have the taxes filed via a tax accountant who is an expert in the field of finance.</p> <p>If you are caught doing any of the above or the income tax office raises a scrutiny on you, you have to furnish extensive documentation of your finances, like bank statements, credit card statements, for all family members. Once you are served a notice by the income tax department you have to appear before the income tax officer within a specified time period. It is not necessary that you have to appear in person, you may send your chartered accountant (if you have one) to represent your case and who will plead on your behalf.</p> <p> The reasons why you should avoid tax evasions are; it is an illegal activity in India under the Indian penal code. Which means it is a crime to willfully conceal income to evade income tax and you are liable to be fined hefty penalties if you care caught evading tax. The penalties levied could be as high as three times the income, which you may have hidden from scrutiny. For example if the scrutiny finds that you have not declared income to the tune of 1 lakh rupees, you could be charged a penalty up to 3 lakh rupees. In case of extreme cases of non-compliance you could also be served a jail sentence depending up on the gravity of the situation.</p> <p>In closing now that you know the ways and implications of tax evasion, we sincerely hope that you will not evade tax; instead you will avoid tax by being under the legal scope defined by the government and income tax act.</p>",

Personal loan amount is decided and approved based on your income from your salary and other sources if any, and the banks will demand proof of income for the same.</p> <h5>How to apply and what documents are required</h5><p> Student loan is simple to apply, citizen of India are eligible to apply for the loan. The applicant should furnish proof of admittance into a university. The bank requires certain documentation which is mandatory. Some of them are: </p><p>1) Letter of admission from the institution</p><p> 2) The institution fees chart </p><p>3) The students mark sheets and / or degree certificates from the existing institution Loan providers like banks may provide up to hundred percent of the amount required.</p><p> Margins are not required if the amount of the loan taken is up to rupees four lakhs. Indian rules and regulations mandate that 5% of the loan has to be financed by the student themselves; this may vary from bank to bank depending on their policies. Please check with multiple loan providers to arrive at a decision. If you are studying in a foreign country the margin amount on the loan can be as high as 15% of the loan amount that is being requested.</p><p> Personal loan documents differ from bank to bank, but basically you will be required to furnish your salary slips for the past 6 months to 1 year, bank account statements for a period of 6 months to 1 year and other documents like PAN, or Aadhar card.

Some banks or financial institution provide a relaxation period of 6 months to one year, till such time the student secures a job after the completion of studies. During this period the student is exempt from paying the loan amount. This period is also known as a moratorium period. Five to seven years is usually the period of tenure of EMI&rsquo;s (Equated monthly installments) but this can be spread further based on circumstances. Simple interest is calculated by the banks, for the duration of the course on the loan amount. Whereas personal loan, generally repayment starts immediately after the first month from the time the loan is paid out into the account of the borrower. The tenure of the personal loan is fixed at five years and cannot be extended.</p><h5> Tax Benefits</h5><p> While choosing student loan, interest paid is often deductible from your annual taxes.

            title: "What is top up loan or personal loan eligibility ?",
            content: "<p>Wondering which loan to apply for? Let us decode the two choices for you. Choosing a loan or rather any kind of loan is an important decision, and having said that, it also should be used as a last resort, if all other avenues are closed. </p> <p>Let us answer some basic questions and then move onto the recommendations.</p> <h5>Who can avail of a Top-up loan?</h5> <p>Any entities who hold a home loan to their names can apply for a Top-up loan. By far this is the most common form of Top-up loan available. However some providers also provide Top-up loans for personal loans as well, but they are generally more expensive and not recommended.</p> <h5>Pros of a Top-up loan</h5><p> The interest is much cheaper as compared to a personal loan, although it will be slightly more than the interest on the existing home loan by approximately 1.5 % to 2 %. Providers generally charge a processing fee for availing a Top-up loan up to 2.5 %. This is still cheaper compared interest charged on personal loans. &#160;A top-up loan is more easily available, as you already have an existing home loan for which documentation has already been done by the lending institution earlier. If your repayment history for the existing loan is good, that is you have not defaulted on any of the EMI&rsquo;s then your chances of getting a Top-up loan become much higher. You can also avail tax benefits by taking a Top-up loan.</p> <h5>Cons of a Top-up loan</h5><p> A Top-up loan can be availed only, if you already have an existing home loan. The money that is disbursed is to be only used for the purpose of constructing property or for renovation of the house that the loan is taken for.</p> <h5>Who can avail of a personal loan?</h5><p>As the name states, an individual entity can apply for a personal loans for various reasons as per his own choice. The basic documents a person needs to furnish at the time of applying a personal loan are minimum last 6 months bank statement of your salary account.</p> <h5>Pros of a Personal loan</h5><p> The monies availed from personal loans can be used for clearing existing debts, investing, for further education, marriage expenses and just about anything that one can think of including renovating the house.</p> <h5>Cons of a Personal loan</h5><p> The interest rates applicable for personal loans are much higher as compared to Top-up loans. A personal loan has a rigorous verification process and is generally more time consuming and difficult to obtain. Also the documentation needs are extensive. As there is no collateral while applying for a personal, loan, banks and institutions will give priority to people with good credit history and rating. They will check your CIBIL score and have the discretion to approve and reject your loan based on your past history. No tax benefits can be availed by taking a personal loan</p> <h5>Joint Personal or joint Top-up loan</h5><p> You can also apply for joint personal or joint Top-up loans, which are an added advantage; if both the applicants are working entities. This increases the potential to get a higher loan as the loan providers consider joint applications as less risky and also the loan providers like banks can always recover the loan from the second entity if either of them defaults.</p> <h5>Recommendations:<h5><p> The choice whether to choose a Top-up loan or personal loan depends on one's needs. If you require the loan where the sole intention is for constructing a house or renovating the house then you should avail the Top-up loan facility provided for the reasons mentioned above. If your intention is any other aspect, then a personal loan will be the way to go.</p> <p>As the clich&eacute; goes, read all subject matter related documents carefully. One cannot stress enough the importance of this point. As different providers will have different terms and conditions, it is best to narrow down your search by doing a thorough research on the terms and conditions of individual loan providers and then identify a provider who meets your check list.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> GST will be applicable on all banking services availed.</p>",

            id: "How-save-money-from-salary-India-Future",
            title: "How to save money from salary in India for Future",
            content: "<p>If you are one of those people who wonder where all the money went as the month end nears, you are not alone. Majority of the people are in this situation. If you are also working and having a regular source of income, but yet have not got any savings to your name then it is high time that you introspect and make a plan to save money. </p> <p>Why you may ask do I need to save? The reasons outlined below should give you an idea why you should start saving as soon as possible. Does not matter what age group you are in, you may be young, you may be in your middle ages, but you have to start somewhere and the sooner the better.</p> <h5>1) Increasing life span due to advancement in medical technologies</h5><p> As medical science makes new breakthroughs in ailments and diseases, the longevity of your life is increasing. Ailments that were considered life threatening decades ago, have now got cures, or prolong your life. If you are salaried, you will be working till the age of 58, maximum 60 if your company allows it. So where will you have monthly income to spend from age 60 onward if you do not have any savings. </p> <h5>2) Economic downturn</h5><p> The economy may undergo a sudden upheaval due to increasing geopolitical situations. In case of a meltdown in economy, you never know you may suddenly lose your job or may be asked to take a salary cut by your employers. If that happens then to maintain your monthly outgoings you need to have contingency plans and savings in place which will help you to tide over during your moment of financial crisis. .</p> <h5>3) Medical Emergency</h5><p> Even if the economy is stable and you are working, you could come across a medical emergency for yourself or for your near and dear ones. If you have planned for it via medi-claim insurance, then good, but you will still have overheads as medi-claims do not cover all the expenses and you still will have to shell out a substantial amount for that. If you do not have medi-claim insurance, then you will be incurring huge medical costs, which you will have to come up with on your own or will have to dig into whatever little savings that you may have and may end up having to borrow money landing yourself in a debt.</p> <h5>4) Education</h5><p> Higher education and college education fees are going through the roof. You may have always wanted to pursue higher education, but for whatever reasons may have had to postpone your plans. Parents too want the best education for their children. Whatever the case may be, you will need ample amount of monies to fund education. Education cost is forever growing, for example, the cost of engineering was rupees 10000/- per annum in the year 1988. Today the cost of can go up to a few lakhs per rupees per annum in an institution of repute. And if you have to get admission to private colleges, then the fees will be even higher. Considering that costs are climbing at a conservative estimate of 6% to 7% year on year, do your calculations now if you are planning for your child&rsquo;s future education. Find out the current costs and then use a calculator to do the calculation.</p> <h5>5) The power of compounding</h5><p> Compounding them say is the eighth wonder of the world. The early you start the more the effect of compounding gets amplified. Let us take a simple example of two people &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;. Person &ldquo;A&rdquo; is 20 years old and person &ldquo;B&rdquo; is 25 years old. Both start investing the same amount let us say rupees 10000 every year and that the money simply doubles every year for ease of calculation, you can do the math&rsquo;s using an interest percentage between 8 to 12 % depending on how conservative or aggressive your estimates are going to be. The target is to calculate the amount when both of them are 30 years of age. See the table below for calculations</p> <p> <table border='1'> <tr> <td>Age for 'A'</td> <td>Amount for 'A'</td> <td>Age for 'B'</td> <td>Amount for 'B'</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>10000</td> <td>25</td> <td>10000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>21</td> <td>20000</td> <td>26</td> <td>20000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>22</td> <td>40000</td> <td>27</td> <td>40000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>23</td> <td>80000</td> <td>28</td> <td>80000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>24</td> <td>160000</td> <td>29</td> <td>160000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>25</td> <td>320000</td> <td>30</td> <td>3,20,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>26</td> <td>640000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>27</td> <td>1280000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>28</td> <td>2560000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29</td> <td>5120000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30</td> <td>1,02,40,000</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>As you can see from the above table Person &ldquo;A&rdquo; who has started five years earlier than person &ldquo;B&rdquo; makes more than rupees 1 crore till the age of 30, while person &ldquo;B&rdquo; makes just above 3 lakhs by the time he reaches 30 years of age. Hence you will see the power of compounding when you start early.</p> <h5>6) Security, retirement and a stress free life</h5><p> You will need the approximately the same amount of money after your retirement to sustain your current lifestyle. So you need to calculate your current monthly expenses and calculate the monies required per month after taking into account the average rate of inflation up to the age you think you may require money for. If you can invest early, you can make your hard earned money work for you in a way that the interest that you obtain from your investments becomes more or less equal to your monthly outflow. In such a situation, you would have a stress free life, and could take up jobs that give you more satisfaction (maybe lesser pay) or give you the chance to fulfill your dreams, without any help from anyone. So the next time you get a bonus or some extra cash from other sources, think before splurging it all, instead use the above mentioned reasons as guidelines to a healthy and wealthy living.</p>",

            content: "<p>When faced with a challenge like the like the title above, where does one begin? It&rsquo;s not easy an easy job to put numbers to something that is just not quantifiable. We will attempt to put vague estimate in rupee terms and try and arrive at a suitable monthly take home pay that a house wife should ideally be entitled to. Having said that, the estimates will vary from every family to family and the assumptions given below should be used only as guide lines and not to be taken as actual numbers. Now that the disclaimer is clear, let us endeavor to decode the mathematics to compute the salary of a house wife.</p> <p>Miss India Manushi Chillar was spot on when she said that mothers deserve the highest salary in the world. The jobs that an average stay at home mother or wife does are completely taken for granted by majority of the families, not only in India, but around the world. This makes it one of the most thankless jobs in the world. A house wife has to juggle multiple roles around the clock, and this she has to do it 365 days in a year, weekend holidays, falling sick, or time offs are not an option.</p> <p>Some of the most common roles and the approximate averages and conservative costs associated with them are provided below.

The above are just a few major roles that come to mind, but there are countless other small tasks that need to be done on a daily basis. One should be thankful and gratuitous that if you have a spouse who is a housewife, then you really need to start paying her a salary or pocket money as per the above. So that she really does not have to seek anyone&rsquo;s permission on how to spend the money and can do so at her own discretion.</p>",

            content: "<p>If you do not have an expense budget created, it&rsquo;s about time you made one. The benefits that you derive from it will be of great help. It will take some time to get used to making one as it requires discipline which is quite easy to break. But once you see the benefits, you will not be able to do without it. If you know how to use spreadsheets then this task becomes even easier, as you can automate it to some extent. If you are not tech savvy, we still recommend that you maintain a dairy or a note book and pen down your expenses</p> <p>The very first thing that you need to calculate is the net income that you receive monthly. This is the amount of money that you actually get in the hand, after deductions like tax, provident fund etc. Once you have figured out a number that you will get month on month, you use this number as your base for further calculations and for making of the budget.</p> <p>Now that you have a number to work with, the next thing to do is start keeping a tab on your daily expenditure. Jot down everything, no matter how small the amount or how big the amount. This way at the end of the month you will be able to figure out if you are over spending or are able to save money or are just at break even.</p> <p>After you have kept tab on the spending&rsquo;s for about a month, the next thing to do is to start categorizing the line items that you have written. A few examples of categories would be Travel, Food, Salary for maids, School fees (if you have children), and EMI&rsquo;s (if you carry a home loan). Also wrote down any premiums for insurance or medi-claim etc. that you may have to pay. Once you start categorizing from the second month, you can start fine tuning the categorization to suit your requirements. Further categories to the above examples can be, Travel for office, Travel for work, Food for home, Food for entertainment in hotels, or parties, or treats. Keep refining your spends and eventually you will have more clarity on what you are spending your hard earned monies on.</p> <p>After three months of meticulously keeping a tab on the spending&rsquo;s, you are now ready for an analysis of the spending&rsquo;s. You will now be able to figure out between, static spends and flexible spends. Examples of flexible spends can be petrol money, or taxi money which will vary from month to month. Static spends it will be very difficult to try and make cuts upon. Examples of static expenses are your electricity bill, rent, or maintenance bill, etc. Flexible spends can be controlled to a certain extent. You can also take help of your credit card monthly statements as they provide an item wise listing of your spending habits.</p> <p>Now that you have a good amount of clarity on your spending patterns, it&rsquo;s time to define goals. You can break up the goals into two parts, one is short term goals and the other is long term goals. Short term goals horizon can be as small as 6 months up to a year or max two years like, planning a vacation, or planning to buy a car, or to buy household electronic items, like refrigerator, television, washing machine etc. Long term goals can vary anywhere from 5 year onward, depending on your requirements. You could have a goal, to buy a house of your own, or to fund your children&rsquo;s education or marriage. Once you have a list of goals, you need to prioritize them. There are goals that are a must have, and there are goals that are nice to have. Give priority to the former. Remember goals can be flexible too and can be changed or interchanged. Your budget which you have now started tracking will help you in your goal setting. If you find that you are overspending, it would be a good idea to reduce your credit card spending&rsquo;s.</p> <p>The next step is to plan, now that you have your goals and spending metrics in place. You will need to sit back and make adjustments. If you are someone who watches movies in a theatre, then chances are you are also eating outside and traveling in a cab, which add to the expenses. It just might be a good idea to consider, watching a movie at home, which will help you curtail your expenses. This is one of the example and they will vary from individual to individual. Do a thorough analysis of where you can cut costs and then take a firm decision to stick to it.</p> <p>You will now be in a better position to take calls, as to where you need to invest your savings, and towards which goal you will apportion how much money based on the priority and the short term or long term goal. As we mentioned earlier, if after adjusting the variable expenses you still need to save more money, then it&rsquo;s time to take a hard look at your static expenses and see if you can cut some corners somewhere.</p> <p>Now that you have created an expense budget and have learned to maintain it, analyze it and track it regularly, one last thing remains, and that is to ensure, to keep reviewing your expenses budget regularly. While a few components of your budget may be non- negotiable, you should always review, your company may give you a raise, or you may get an unexpected bonus, or your short term goal may have been accomplished and you now need to plan for a new short term goal. Reasons will come and go, but keep reviewing and analyzing continuously.</p>",

            title: "What is Long and Short term financial goal setting",
            content: "<p>What are financial goals and how does one go about achieving them? That is a question that most of us have asked at some point in our life. Having a financial goal, will give you a sense of purpose and once you have created it, it will also give you a purpose and a meaning of fulfilment. So without wasting any more time let us try and understand the steps to setting a financial goal. Remember planning is the key and it has to be as detailed as possible. First of all you need to assess the ground reality and calculate how much your current net worth is. This can easily be done, by adding up all the monies that you have in your banks, or mutual funds, or equities or any other savings instruments. You then need to figure out your current debts in form of any loans, or credit card outstanding that you may have. You need to subtract your debts from your savings to arrive at your net worth. Now that you know what your net worth is, the next step is to have a budget for your daily expenses which needs to be monitored regularly, so that you know what savings you have at the end of every month. Before starting out on goal setting, as a general rule, ensure that you have no outstanding debts. You need to have a contingency or emergency fund in place. As a thumb rule set up an emergency fund first, this is usually around 3 to 6 months of your expenses and will give you the comfort in case of any medical emergency or job loss or any other disaster that may occur. If the outstanding on loans or credit card payment are high, then it is recommended that you take care of this first and then move towards a contingency fund. If you have multiple outstanding debts then it is suggested that you evaluate the interest component on each one and calculate which has the highest interest rate and then pay the highest interest rate debt off first, as against an outstanding where the base amount may be higher, but interest is lower. Paying off your outstanding debts should be one of your short term financial goals. The next step is now to jot down your goals, it can be as simple as noting it down on paper or a simple excel spreadsheet. Recommend the latter; as it is easier to put in formulas for calculations. You can start of by dividing the goals into three sections, namely, longer duration goals with a horizon of more than 10 years, mid &ndash; term goals with a view of 5 years to 10 years and short term goals having a duration of anywhere between 1 year to 5 years. You can tweak the numbers to suit your requirements. Once you have identified the range, it is time to come up with specific goals to go under each range. Let us look at some examples for each range to give you an idea to come up with your own set of goals. </p><h5>Short term goals:</h5> <p>If you have always wanted to have a vacation in a foreign country, or you want to furnish your apartment, or plan a treat for your near and dear ones at a fancy restaurant on special occasions.</p><h5> Medium term goals:</h5><p> You may want to purchase a car at the end of give years, or renovate your dwellings completely, you will need to save a substantial amount of money for these activities. </p><h5>Long term goals:</h5><p> These are generally savings for retirement or higher education for your children, or their marriage, you may want to retire early etc. Now that you have a draft of your goals, the next step is to prioritize. Figure out which goals you want to give priority and apportion a higher amount from your savings towards the same. Analyze your cash flow and other outgo like insurance premiums. Do not over insure as the extra money can be allocated towards a goal. Have just enough insurance to cover contingencies. Try and create multiple streams of revenue. Having alternate streams of incomes, is an important financial goal. Adjust your lifestyle so that you are spending less than what you are earning. As a thumb rule try the 30 / 30 / 40 combination for savings from your income. That is 30% of your income savings to be spent for your day to day expenses. 30 % of your income should be allotted for home loans, or other outstanding debts, and 40 % in investments in the form of mutual funds, equities, fixed deposits etc. These percentage numbers can be tweaked to suit your requirements. Over a period of time once your loans and outstanding are paid off, then the 30 % which was allocated towards outstanding, should be reallocated. 10% of the 30% to be added to your day to day expenses which will take it to 40% and 20% of the 30% towards investment which will take it to 60% in investments. It is also advisable to take help from someone who is an expert to aid you in your financial planning and goals. There are a lot of people out there who call themselves financial experts, so do your research, check up on their credentials and past track record and choose wisely. With the above guidance you will have taken your first step towards financial planning for yourself, which in the long term will be beneficial to tackle any obstacles that may arise.</p>",

            content: "<p>In India the age of retirement in pegged at 58 years for most companies, some companies allow their employees an extension up to 2 years, taking the age of retirement to 60 years. All of us at some point of time have had the desire to retire early and have secretly wished to ourselves that one day we will quit from the rat race, but these just remain pipe dreams for majority of the people. There are however a minority, who retire early. How do they do it? It is one of the most difficult tasks to achieve, but not impossible. You need to have a lot of grit and determination and lots of self-control to make it happen. The first thing to do is introspect and figure out an age that you may want to retire at, depending up on what your current age is. If you are young and have just started working then the goal to retire early could be at 45 years of age. The older you are the more aggressive approach is what you will have to consider. Why would one consider retiring early? The obvious answer is the benefits that one can derive. When you retire early, you have ample amount of time at your disposal. You will save your commute time to work, and the work time itself which is a bulk of the time. You can pursue hobbies and interests that you may have had when you were younger, but have had to forgo, due to the responsibilities of earning for you and your family. You can travel, to different places, without having to apply for leaves and waiting for approvals. You can start a second career which is your passion. You can opt for part time work which is productive and fulfilling, or you can take up freelancing to supplement your income after retirement. After you retire early, some of the main challenges that you may have to face are, not having enough funds to live on as per your existing lifestyle and catering to any emergencies. You need to build this in while you do your retirement planning. You may also want to consider your life span as an approximation. If you do retire at 45; which is a number that we are going to use in this article. Then your life expectancy may be 80, 85, and 90. You need to account for your longevity. Let us take a sample and theoretical calculation. Please note you will have to do research on the current status of the numbers and adjust the same accordingly to come up with your own set of numbers. The example below is hypothetical and numbers are an approximate calculation. Let us say person &ldquo;A&rdquo; earns around 1 lakh rupees a month. His necessary expenses per month are 30% which is Rs/- 30,000 per month. So for person &ldquo;A&rdquo; to retire he must be able to produce Rs/- 30000 per month. At a conservative estimate of 7 % interest rate per annum, he will currently require a corpus of Rs/- 52 lakhs to produce Rs 30,000 per month equivalent of today, twenty years from now.  Twenty years from now if you consider inflation at 8% per annum, the corpus required works out to 1.7 crores. This works out to 8.5 lakhs per annum for the next twenty years or approximately investments of Rs 71000 per month. It is indeed a mammoth task to set aside Rs 71000 per month for the average Indian.  So what are the strategies that one could apply in order to achieve this number. Let us know put into place a macro strategy, you can fine tune it suit your retirement goals. </p><h5>Make your hard earned money work for you</h5><p> The route to making your money work for you is by investing it and using the power of compounding work in your favor. While you may allocate some funds towards safe instruments like fixed deposit and government bonds. It is recommended to invest into equity based mutual funds. If you are not financially savvy then engage the services of an expert to guide you. You could invest in aggressive or conservative mutual funds or both, depending on your risk appetite. Even if you do hire an expert, ensure that you monitor and track your investments regularly on your own. </p><h5>Alternative careers to supplement existing to fund early retirement</h5><p> While having a primary job, look out for opportunities in part time career or consultancy to add to the monthly income. This way you will be able to save more and add to the number of Rs 71000/- . </p><h5>Modification to existing lifestyle</h5></p> Discipline is the key, you will have to make major changes to your lifestyle and it will take all your willpower and self-control to ensure that you maintain the necessary only lifestyle. You can categorize your expenses into somethings that are absolutely necessary, somethings which provide you comfort and lastly things which are purely luxury. Once you identify the above it becomes easy to put a number to each of the categories. This will help you in overspending. Build a corpus first for the necessary things and then for the other categories. You can also consider moving cities and relocating to places where the spending is relatively less and more affordable. Cutting out excess spending, and making these small additions will create a huge impact I the long run. The only challenges one must be aware of are the bad habits of needless spending and one&rsquo;s inability to get an alternate revenue stream. These could act as deterrents to limit your ability to attain early retirement. Create a roadmap and stick to it, you may modify it as you go along, but it should not compromise your retirement goals. The goal should be non-negotiable. Once you have a roadmap in place and have made a resolve to stick to it, you will be on your way to financial freedom, once you attain financial freedom you will be on auto pilot toward an early retirement.</p>",

            title: "Best reasons to have credit card for salaried person in India",
            content: "<p>Let us begin by saying that one should try to avoid getting into a debt, no matter how small or large and especially credit card debts. Credit card debts are the dangerous and can easily spiral out of control if you do not know how to wield your monies wisely.</p><p> Let us try and analyze, whether we really need to have a credit card in today&rsquo;s digital era. </p><p>If you do not have a credit card, then it is one less bill to track and pay at the end of every month. It is a must for one to pay off by the due date. If you pay your dues after the due date, the credit card institutions will levy a huge late fee. If you do not pay or pay only the minimum amount due then the interest component charged is on the entire amount and this can range between a minimum of 18% per annum to as high as 36% per annum. This will go on compounding and before you know it, the amount will be so high that you may actually have to apply for a loan to pay off the credit card dues, or declare bankruptcy.</p><p> Having credit cards, lulls you into a false sense of security and you tend to lose control when you are doing the actual spends. If you are someone who has a monthly budget chalked out, then having a credit card can directly hamper the budget and make you lose control. It&rsquo;s easy to be tempted when there is a sale going on at a mall or if you are just window shopping. Alternatively if you tend to pay cash, the mind will be forced to think about the money that you need to pay from your wallet in physical form and this may help to curb your instinct of buying at the spur of the moment. At times small but multiple purchases throughout the month may add up and put a big dent in your budget. You may be at a restaurant with friends or family and may be tempted to pay the entire bill, you may purchase a souvenir or some fancy small ticket item for the house which you may not really need, or buy something just because it is the latest fashion to do so.</p><p> If you are not tech savvy, you could fall prey to the numerous credit card scams both online and offline, where scammers, will skim your credit card details and go on a purchasing spree and you will end up footing the bill. It is a myth that you need credit card spending to generate a good credit score. While this may be true to a certain extent, this will only happen if you pay of all your dues on time and in full before the due date. There are other options to creating a good credit score like paying your EMI&rsquo;s of your home loans on time and paying your utility bills like telephone and electricity on time. This too will help you to generate a good credit rating.</p><p> Another myth is that the rewards that I get from credit card purchases. This again will hold good if you pay off your bills on time, if however you miss a payment then the late fees and interest alone will wipe out any gains that you may receive against the rewards. Also check for any annual fees, which may outweigh the rewards gains.</p><p> Banks prefer to provide credit cards to almost everyone who is in employment. They make their monies on the people who are defaulters who are a majority.</p><p> To be debt free is to be free from any tensions. If you do not have a credit card, you will be unable to fall into the credit card trap and be free from any worries, as you will be actually spending on what you need rather than what you want. The difference between need and want is huge, while a need is a must have and one cannot do without it, a want is something that is nice to have but one can do without it.</p><p> If you arrive at a decision to get rid of your existing card or do without one, then one should plan ahead for any emergencies or contingencies that may arise due to a job loss, or medical situation or any unforeseen circumstances. In such case one must build an emergency fund consisting of minimum of three months to six months to one year in expenses, based on your needs.</p><p> Credit cards however have their advantages too; you get a credit period of up to 45 days from the date of making a purchase, which means you have time to roll your money. Credit card companies&rsquo; give you cash back offers, wherein a certain amount of cash is given back to you based on the purchase and it differs with every vendor. If you used wisely, you can benefit from the reward points that you get on credit cards. These can be used to redeem gifts or gift vouchers. In case you are making a bulk payment it can be converted to flexi payment in the form of EMI. So if you pay off your complete dues on or before the due date, then credit cards are a hand tool to have.</p><p> Having said that, debit cards can be substituted in lieu of credit cards. They help you to control your spends as you need to have the amount of money in your account before making the spend. Only in extenuating circumstances where it warrants the use of a credit card for online booking or other avenues where credit card is the only option, one must use a credit card.</p>",

            content: "<p>First of all, let us define what it means when a cheque is dishonored. If person A, issues a cheque to person B and for whatever reason, the bank does not pay the amount to person B, the cheque is considered to be dishonored.</p> <p>The bank will also issue a memo to person A stating the reason for the dishonor. Person A can correct the details as per the memo issued by the bank and then re-submit the cheque within three months from the date it was issued.</p><p> Person A also needs to pay the amount to person B within a period of thirty days from the date of issue, failing which person B can initiate legal proceedings against person B. Section 138 of the negotiable instruments Act, 1881 will be applicable for cases of dishonor of cheque. Violation of this will carry a penalty or a prison sentence up to two years or both.</p> <p>Let us know understand seven reasons as to why the bank may dishonor your cheque.</p> <h5>Bank balance insufficient:</h5><p> This is by far the most common reason for dishonor of cheque. You may inadvertently issue a cheque for the 1st of the month, but for some reason if your salary is delayed then your bank will have insufficient funds due to which the cheque will get dishonored. Always ensure that you have sufficient bank balance before issuing any cheque.</p><h5> Missing out on writing the payee name: </h5><p>While writing cheque in a hurry, you may unintentionally miss out on writing the name of the person you are issuing the cheque to. At times you may write the amount in figures, but forget to write it in words, or the amount in words will not match the amount written in numbers, the banks will then reject the cheque in such instances.</p><h5> Modification of cheque:</h5><p> Once you have written all the details on the cheque, no modification is allowed, you cannot do a re-correction anywhere on the details, or cannot strike out a word and add another one in its place. Even if you overwrite with your pen on a single letter or a digit the cheque will be dishonored. So take your time and have the details before hand with you.</p><h5> Issue date expired:</h5><p> The validity of a cheque is for three months from the date of issue. If for any reason you submit the cheque in the bank after the validity period, the bank will reject the cheque. Always submit the cheque well before the date of expiry.</p><h5> Signature mismatch:</h5><p> This is again one of the collective causes for cheque dishonor. If the signature that you have on the cheque does not match with the signature in the bank records then banks will dishonor the cheque. This could happen for a number of reasons, your signature may have changed over the years and you have forgotten the specimen signature that you had made at the time of opening the account. In such case, resubmit your current signature to the bank for the records to be updated.</p><h5> Stop Payment:</h5><p> This could happen due to a variety of purposes. The person issuing the cheque could have issued a stop payment mandate if there is a loss in the form of theft or cheque is misplaced. The account may have been frozen due to order by government or by the court of law. If for some reason the account is closed by the person issuing the cheque and the cheque is deposited afterward. The bank will decline from making the payment in such cases.</p><h5> Dormant account:</h5><p> Banks can dishonor the cheque issued, if the account is lying dormant or has been inoperative for some time. Now that you know the main causes, ensure that you take care of the above points while writing out a cheque to someone or while depositing a cheque, so that the amount gets cleared seamlessly.</p>",

            content: "<p>The moment that you have been waiting is finally upon you. After painstakingly hunting around, you have identified the perfect house, which meets all your requirements. It is in a good locality, with all the amenities that one requires nearby to the house. You joyfully approach a bank or a home loan institution to obtain a loan. After some waiting, you are told that your home loan has been rejected. Your mind goes blank, trying to figure out what went wrong and you see your dream come crashing down on you like a ton of bricks.</p><p>   Let us see some of the pitfalls that one might face for rejection of loans. </p><p>  The most important one being your CIBIL score (Credit Reports and Risk Management Solutions). If you currently have a bad score, then the chances of rejection of not only your home loan but any other loan that you may take will be very high. At times you may have a good credit rating, but still find that the loan is getting rejected. This may be due to your past track record of defaulting on other loans, or missing payments of credit cards and sometimes even not paying of telephone bills are considered. If your income tax filing is also irregular, this too will affect your credit score. The first thing to do is obtain your CIBIL score, analyze it and try and fix it before you proceed to apply for a home loan. Sometimes the credit rating agency may also have made an error which you need to rectify. Credit score is calculated over a period; hence it makes sense to pay all your bills on time and not to default on even the smallest of bills.</p><p>   The prospective builder or his property may not have been approved by the bank. This is slightly tricky as certain builders maybe approved by the bank; however certain projects of the builder have not yet been approved. Or the property may be approved by the bank, but the builder may not yet have been approved by the bank that you have approached to take a loan from. It is also possible that some other bank or institution may have approved both the property and the builder, in which case you will have to do your homework and approach the bank that has approved both the parameters.</p><p>   The sale price is another important factor. If the buyer and the seller have agreed to a price, then it is not necessary that the bank will consider your price. They will have their own methods of evaluation, which is generally based on the ready reckoner for the area where the property is located. The bank will then decide upon a price which they think is fair value of the property and sanction a loan based on that fair value instead of your buy price. If the fair price is higher than your price, you will have no issues, but if the fair value is lesser than your buy price, then the amount of loan sanctioned will be much lesser than your expectation. Please note that this general happens when there is a re-sale of property and especially when the house under consideration is very old. </p><p>  If you have just started your career either as a business person or are an employee, then it will be difficult to get a loan in the first few years, as banks will consider you as a risk, till such time you are well settled and have a proven track record over a few years of having growth. For the salaried class if you if you keep changing jobs frequently, banks will consider the instability of holding onto a job as one of the factor for rejection. Research says that the salaried class holds onto to a job for a minimum of three years to avoid your loan being rejected. Your age too is considered, as banks generally give the tenure as 15 to 20 years, and the more closer you are to your retirement age, the EMI&rsquo;s will be quite high so that one may not be able to afford it.</p><p>   The above are some of the major reasons for banks for rejecting loans. In conclusion, one should start early, keep a clean track record of payments no matter how small they are, this will help to keep ones credit rating high and the chances for rejection will then become low.</p>",

                content: "<p>Common mistakes that investors make unknowingly and the impact of these mistakes on their lives. </p> <h5>Mistake#2: Not saving for the future</h5> <p>We all tend to live in the present and not many of us plan for the future. It is good to not worry too much about the future, but that doesn’t mean that you completely ignore your future. You need to understand that there might come a day when you can no longer earn steadily. What will happen if you don’t have a steady source of income? You cannot afford your lifestyle and face a severe money shortage. Imagine, if you retire at the age of 60 years with a bank balance that will serve you for only five years? Well, you need to avoid that and therefore, you need to save! </p> <h5>Mistake#3: No term plan</h5> <p>An <strong>accident</strong> can change everything. No one can foresee an accident or even prevent one. However, the one thing that we can do is plan such that we can reduce our losses from an accident. There are numerous accidents that take place daily and it makes sense to protect yourself from such contingencies than to suffer a huge and unexpected loss. Therefore, it is a good idea to insure your life and the lives of your family members as well. In case of the unavoidable, at least the ones you care for will not suffer. </p> <h5>Mistake#4: Over investing in fixed deposits</h5> <p><strong>Fixed deposit</strong> is a secure investment. You simply need to park your funds in a secured account and it will grow in value over the years. So, what is the problem with this investment? Unlike other investments, fixed deposits don’t outgrow the inflation in the economy. It means that you might think that your <strong>investments</strong> increase but their purchasing power stays the same.</p> <h5>Mistake#5: Incurring too much debt </h5> <p>Investors are usually of two kinds – on who buy things with the money they save and the other who usually makes purchases with their future earnings (loans). The ‘purchase now and pay later’ attitude just increases the <strong>debt</strong> while the income might or might not increase. This is a wrong attitude to go about your expenses. Before you know it, you will be knee deep in debt. </p>",

You probably came across restaurants that never mentioned any taxes in their previous bills have started to charge 18% taxes in the name of GST. You might wonder why you must learn about this. Well, fake GST numbers allow the businesses to charge <strong>tax</strong> from the customers even when the business is not registered with the GST department.</p> <p>A common man might think that with the introduction of GST, everything is costlier by 12-18%. However, if the <strong>business</strong> does not register itself with the GST department, all the so-called GST they charge directly goes into their pocket. You no longer have to fall prey to this seemingly vicious scheme. It is quite easy to verify the GST number and you can do so in less than 30 seconds. </p> <p>The GST number consists of 15 characters and it can be broken down into 5 parts. The first two digits show the state code, the next 10 digits show the PAN of the registered business, the 13th digit is the registration number of the business, the 14th digit is ‘Z’ by default and the last digit is the check code. </p> <p>The first step is to check the GST number printed on the bill or the receipt. The business needs to mention their GST number and if it isn’t, then you don’t have to pay the tax. Not just that, but it is illegal to charge GST if the number is not mentioned on the <strong>invoice</strong>. </p> <p>Once you see the GST number, you need to visit the GST website of the <strong>government</strong> and enter the given GST number. Then enter the Captcha as displayed and click on Submit. </p> <p>If the GST number is not fake, then you will see the registered business name on the website and it needs to match the one that’s printed on the invoice. </p> <p>There are some businesses that don’t have a confirmed <strong>registration</strong> number but instead have a provisional GST number. Well, don’t you worry! You can still verify the same. You need to visit the official GST website, then select the option of “verify provisional ID status.” You need to enter the necessary details like the state, ID type, ID number and the verification code. Once you enter the necessary details, you can check if the concerned business does in fact have a provisional GST number or not. </p> <p>A business can have a registered GST number or a provisional GST number. Regardless of the status of approval, no one can charge you for GST if they don’t mention the number on the invoice. </p> <p>If you ever come across any business or establishment with a fake GST number or no GST number, then you can contact the following.

Income tax is the tax that you need to pay on your income or your earnings. In fact, it is one of the most popular taxes and the least understood concept of personal finance. Why do you have to pay income tax? Tax is the source of revenue for the <strong>government</strong> and it helps fund all governmental activities and services for the public. Everyone who earns an income needs to file income tax returns. </p> <p>Evert taxpayer needs to declare their income to the <strong>IT department</strong> at the end of the financial year in the form prescribed by the government. This form is the ITR and it is summarized statement of your incomes in a given time frame. The different forms of income include salaries, pensions, income from business or a profession, other sources like interest and dividends, capital gains, income from house property and the like. The CBDT prescribes seven forms and you can use any of these forms to file your IT returns. The forms are ITR 1, ITR2A, ITR 2, ITR 3, ITR 4S, ITR 4, ITR 5, ITR 6 and ITR 7.</p> <p>There are different benefits of filing <strong>Income Tax Returns</strong>. If you want to take a loan or even apply for a Visa, then you need a proof of income tax return that you file. You don’t need to have taxable income to file IT returns. It helps to build a proof of your finances or your source of income. If your income is less than the taxable limit, but your employer has charged <strong>TDS</strong> (Tax Deducted at Source) or if you earn some income from any part-time consultancy work and the company deducted TDS @ 10%, then you can claim a refund of the TDS hence deducted. You are entitled to this refund, if your income is below the taxable limit. If you want to claim this refund, then you must file your IT returns.</p> <p>The ITR is not only a proof of your income, but it is also a proof that you have duly paid your taxes for the income you earn in any financial year.</p> <p>You need to file ITR in the following cases: </p> <ul> <li>If your gross total income exceeds 2.5 lakhs. </li> <li>The income earned or accrued by an NRI in India. </li> <li>If you want to carry forward any losses incurred like capital losses or business losses. </li> <li>If you want to claim a refund. </li> <li>If TDS is deducted on any income you earn. </li> </ul> <p>Did you know that in a country with a population of more than 1 billion, only 3% are liable to pay their income tax? Tax evasion and the non-filing of Income Tax Returns is illegal (it means that it can be penalized). So, file your income tax returns on time and avoid all the hassle.</p>",

                content: "<p>Health is wealth, but how do you select the perfect health insurance plan?</p> <p>Here are the important factors that you need to consider before you decide to buy any <strong>health insurance. </strong></p> <h5>Claim Process</h5> <p>Claim process is the time that’s necessary for settlement. It is vital that you select an insurance policy with a simple <strong>claim</strong> process and cashless benefit. Look for good customer support service as well.</p> <h5>Waiting Period</h5> <p>The period that you need to wait for before you can apply to claim your insurance for a pre-existing medical condition. Regardless of the insurance company you choose, all policies have a waiting period. You need to select one that doesn’t have a lengthy waiting period. </p> <h5>Lifetime renewal</h5> <p>Policies tend to have different rules regarding renewability. Some are limited up to 60-70 years and others offer lifetime renewability. Always opt for a policy that offers lifetime renewability.</p> <h5>Room rent cap</h5> <p>In case of any <strong>hospitalization</strong>, the insured person is entitled to the room rent payable. So, you need to check the cap on the room rent chargeable. Make sure that the policy will pay for a major or the entire rent of the room.</p> <h5>Claim ratio</h5> <p>There are various instances where an insurance claim is either delayed or even rejected by the insurer company. To avoid such troubles, it is a good idea to do a background check and read about the IRDA ratio for claim settlements. A higher ratio implies that the insurance company is trustworthy. </p> <h5>Hospital networks </h5> <p>Carefully go through the information about cashless hospital networks before you purchase a health insurance policy. In case of a medical emergency, it is helpful if you have the option for cashless settlement. </p> <h5>Maternity benefits </h5> <p>There are only a few insurance policies that offer full maternity benefits. If you are recently married or are starting a family soon, then you must check for maternity benefits the policy offers. The cost of pregnancy is increasing steadily by the day and it is better to be prepared for such an expense. </p> <h5>Sub-limit</h5> <p>The sub limit is the monetary cap that the insurer has for an insurance claim. Sub-limits are applicable to different expenses like the room rent, consultation charges of doctors, ambulance charges and any other medical procedures. Either opt for a policy with a high or no sub-limit.</p> <h5>Pre and post hospitalization </h5> <p>Medical treatments usually require pre and post hospitalization and the same is applicable for medicines. Therefore, it is prudent to opt for a policy that covers pre and post hospitalization expenses. </p> <h5>Coverage for critical illnesses </h5> <p>There are certain illnesses that can lead to permanent disability or even death. A good <strong>health insurance policy</strong> needs to provide for such circumstances. </p> <p>The other things that you need to consider are the sum assured, OPD expenses, dental treatments and no claim bonus. Apart from this, you must also check if the insurance policy is for only the insured individual or if it is a family floater.</p>",

Well, don’t you worry! There are a couple of simple ways in which you can save the tax payable. Yes, all the tips mentioned in this section are legal.</p> <p>80C</p> <p>Section 80C of the Income Tax Act provides different categories of income that are deductible from your income. If you deduct certain incomes, then the tax payable will automatically reduce. Items that are exempt under this section include </p> <ul> <li>Public Provident Fund (PPF),</li> <li>National Savings Certificate (NSC),</li> <li>Principal that you repay on home loan, </li> <li>Life insurance premium</li> <li>Deposits with maturity period of minimum five years in bank and the post office.</li> </ul> <h5>Maturity amount or life insurance claim </h5> <p>The amount that you receive on the maturity or by the claim of a life insurance policy is exempt from taxation. However, the precondition that the annual premium assured on the policy doesn’t exceed 20% of the amount assured. If the premium exceeds 20%, then the entire amount you receive is taxable.</p> <h5>Education scholarship </h5> <p>If you receive an education scholarship either from the government or from a private trust, the same is exempt from taxation. The amount you receive as scholarship money is not to be included in the calculation of total income.</p> <h5>Profits from the sale of equity mutual funds/shares </h5> <p>If you hold any equity mutual funds or shares for one year before you sell it, then any profits that you receive from such a sale is exempt from taxation. Such a sale is a long-term capital gain and it is exempt. You need to wait for a period of more than 365 days (366 in a leap year) if you want to claim this exemption. Any sale made before the completion of one year is taxable.</p> <h5>Dividend on equity mutual funds or shares </h5> <p>If you receive any periodical dividends from equity mutual funds or shares, then such a dividend is exempt from taxation. For instance, if you purchase stock and receive a dividend of Rs 30,000 within a period of 10 months, it will still be exempt.</p> <h5>Any gift received on marriage </h5> <p>The gifts you receive on marriage are not taxable. However, this exemption is a one-time benefit. So, any monetary gift (cash or cheque) that you receive on occasion of marriage is not to be included in the calculation of total income. </p> <h5>Interest on savings account</h5> <p>The interest that you receive from your savings account is exempt from taxation up to the amount of Rs 10,000. If the interest you receive is more than Rs 10,000, then the rest will be taxable.</p> <h5>Medical insurance </h5> <p>Any medical insurance claim you receive up to the amount of Rs 15,000 on an insurance policy for self, spouse or dependent children is exempt from taxation. </p> <h5>Any charity </h5> <p>The provisions of 80G specify that any money given, as charity is exempt from the provisions of taxation. </p>",

                content: "<p>A higher <strong>credit card limit</strong> is not just a status symbol, but something that is quite useful. </p> <p>What exactly does a credit limit mean? As the name suggests, it is the maximum sum of <strong>money</strong> that you can <strong>borrow</strong> from a bank on a given credit card. You can use the credit limit to make any purchases like you normally do. The only difference is that, instead of drawing your funds from your savings account, you create a debt account with your bank. The bank will keep a track of your transactions and will accordingly revise your credit limit based on your transactional history and repayment capacity. </p> <p>There are different parameters that a bank uses to decide the credit limit for individual <strong>credit card applicants</strong>. These criteria include income, credit score and monthly <strong>salary</strong> of a person. According to their credit policy, then bank will decide the credit limit after scrutinizing all these criteria. Don’t fret if the bank offers you a low credit limit. Banks usually revise the credit limit within a period of six to eighteen months, according to the financials and the repayment record. If you pay your bills on time and improve your financial health, then the bank will increase your credit limit as well.</p> <h5>Benefits of a higher credit limit </h5> <p>A major advantage of a <strong>high credit limit</strong> on your credit card is that you can reduce your credit utilization ration, provided you use it judiciously. A lower credit utilization ratio will improve your credit score. For instance, if the credit limit on your card is Rs 50,0000 and you use Rs 25,000 a month, then your credit utilization ratio is 50%. Now, if the credit limit is increased to Rs 75,000 and you spend Rs 25,000 a month, then your credit utilization ratio is 33%. It means that your credit score will improve. </p> <p>If you want to obtain a loan with a bank, then you can use your credit limit to get a better deal for yourself. Banks are prudent when they offer higher credit limits to their customers. If a bank issues a higher credit limit, it means that the bank considers the said individual to be a safe asset. </p> <p>It is always better to have one high-limit credit card than to have different credit cards with lower limits. If it is just one card, then you simply need to track the expenses made with the concerned card and don’t have to worry about keeping a track of different expenses made on different cards. </p> <p>In the face of a financial emergency, a high credit limit certainly comes in handy. You can use the same to obtain loans for self, family members or even friends. You can even obtain personal loans if you have a high credit limit. </p> <p>Another benefit of a high credit limit are all the rewards that you are entitled to on the transactions you make.</p>",

Follow the easy steps mentioned in this post to make the process of <strong>buying a house</strong> simpler. </p> <h5>1) Monthly household expenditure</h5> <p>For any middle-class household in India, buying a house is a major <strong>financial expenditure</strong>. Given that the real estate prices are on a steady incline, it is not possible to buy any property without some financial stretch. If you want to borrow money to purchase a house, then you must cut down on your monthly household expenditure between 25 to 40%. </p> <h5>2) Loan amount </h5> <p>At present, banks provide house loans worth 80% of the value of the property. If you want to borrow from a bank, then you need to be able to fund the remaining 20% on your own. This amount must not be raised through another loan or debt. Ideally, it is advisable that you contribute at least 40% of the down payment from your savings to reduce a financial strain. </p> <h5>3) Liabilities</h5> <p>It is important that you make a list of all the liabilities that you might face in the next six months. Liabilities can include tuition fee, insurance premium and so on. Ensure that you have sufficient funds to fulfill all these liabilities. </p> <h5>4) Existing loans or debts</h5> <p>You need to clear all the <strong>exiting loans</strong> or debts that you might have before you apply for a housing loan. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to pay off two loans simultaneously.
